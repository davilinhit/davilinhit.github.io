<h2>About</h2>

I'm an electrical engineer and open hardware hacker living near Portland, Oregon.

I worked on Enhanced Vision Systems at <a href="http://max-viz.com">Max-Viz</a> and now I provide small batch, purple printed circuit boards at <a href="http://oshpark.com">OSHPark</a>. I'm available for consulting through <a href="http://wickerbox.net">Wickerbox Electronics</a> and you can find my open source code and schematics on <a href="http://github.com/wicker/">Github</a>.
