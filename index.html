<h5>About</h5>

Hi! I'm an electrical engineer and open hardware hacker living near Portland, Oregon. Lately I've been reading, hiking, growing vegetables, learning to sea kayak, and writing informal, photo-heavy posts for far-flung friends and family. 
<br /><br />
I designed the hardware and software for aircraft cameras with Astronics Max-Viz, and now I help provide purple printed circuit boards at <a href="http://oshpark.com">OSHPark</a>. I release all my code and schematics as <a href="http://github.com/wicker">Wicker on Github</a>. 
<br /><br />
I'm available through Wickerbox Electronics to design circuits, lay out boards, write low-level microcontroller code, develop documentation, give a talk, and/or offer project advice. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:jeh.wicker@gmail.com">jeh.wicker@gmail.com</a>.
