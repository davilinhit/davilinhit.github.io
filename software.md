#### Software

I've written a lot of random scripts and programs, mostly to learn languages or explore ideas. I'm familiar with ARM Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog, C, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Liquid. 

I use Git for version control, and I serve my websites with Jekyll on Github.  

Lately, I've been trying my hand at building web apps using FreeCodeCamp.org's coursework. I'm using Node (Javascript) when I'm not falling back to Flask (Python). Here's what I've built so far:
