#### Software

I've written a lot of random scripts and programs, mostly to learn languages or explore ideas. I'm familiar with ARM Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog, C, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Liquid. 

I use Git for version control, and I serve my websites with Jekyll on Github.

I'm enrolled in the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree.
