        <h3 style="margin: 20px 0 0 20px">Context</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m from Portland, Oregon, but my parents split when I was very young and both my parents moved around a fair bit. I&#8217;ve lived in Forest Grove and out in the Willamette Valley, in Sandy and Boring, in Gresham and Troutdale, but I went to high school in Portland and that&#8217;s where I started both taking pictures and getting into arguments on the internet.</p>
<p>I have dual citizenship with Switzerland and have visited every couple of years all my life. I got my first Real Camera for our 2000 trip, which was, incidentally, where I first got a chance to go paragliding. There&#8217;s not a much better place to fly than under the Eiger.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/paragliding.png">
<p>I made Lincoln&#8217;s Constitutional Law team as a sophomore and we took third in nationals that season, in the spring of 2001. I learned a lot about being social, working in a team, and how much I hated law. In hindsight, I was already a mapper and relentlessly trying to make the world make sense. I just wasn&#8217;t any good at communicating that to anybody.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/conlaw.png">
<p>It was about this time I joined Civil Air Patrol at the Portland Air National Guard base. I don&#8217;t know what kicked off the airplane madness but I&#8217;d always wanted to fly. I was into amateur astronomy and had a habit of scrambling up on the roof to stargaze from our place in the West Hills. I had an emotionally unstable home life and Civil Air Patrol, with its military-style cadet environment, provided some much-needed stability.</p>
<p>I was Cadet <span class="caps">NCO</span> of the Year in 2002 and I graduated high school a year early. I had panicked, realizing how deeply unhappy I was, and rebelled against the system by taking double credits in one year so I could get out. I started at Mt Hood Community College in the fall and shortly thereafter we all moved out to Troutdale, maybe a mile from the college. I had a terrible home environment and no idea how to study, in part I realize now because I was so incredibly stressed and self-hating that information just wouldn&#8217;t stick. My neurochemistry was so shot that I didn&#8217;t have the ability to build mental models, much less retain and develop them.</p>
<p>I returned to Switzerland in 2002 as a 17-year old and you can tell in my photos that I had no idea what photography was for &#8212; I didn&#8217;t see the value so I struggled with wanting to take pictures but having no clear process for how to do so. I did have an eye for composition but not the foggiest clue about lighting. I also didn&#8217;t understand about editing. I think this reflects the greater sense of being seventeen and having no self-confidence, only a quiet desperation to produce <em>some work, any work</em> in hopes that something would pan out.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/charlotte-chess.png">
<p>2003 was the year everything changed. The one bright spot in my life was Civil Air Patrol and airplanes. I made Cadet Commander in 2003 and had a team of a couple of guys who were officers with me. They gave us the responsibility for the other kids so we did things like go up to McChord Air Base in Washington for their airshow. I vividly remember the Thunderbirds; it was all Air Force, all the time. I kept thinking my problems would be solved if I could just get into the Air Force Academy but I just didn&#8217;t have the grades or the support.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/mcchord.png">
<p>I eventually commanding the Oregon Wing Glider Encampment and attending the National Blue Beret encampment at the Oshkosh Air Show, now AirVenture. I was plane-crazy, adrenaline-fueled plane-crazy, and I got to see all the big names &#8212; Bob Hoover, Scott Crossfield, Chuck Yeager. I got to see Neil Armstrong in the Theater in the Woods. My flight leader &#8216;lost me&#8217; for a couple hours so I could watch Burt Rutan talk about SpaceShipOne. The lives these people led, making planes, flying planes, seemed so accessible.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/blueberet.png">
<p>When I went home, I wrote a letter to Scaled Composites and included a self-addressed stamped envelope. I&#8217;m embarrassed about it now but I was failing out of community college and I wanted to know what I could do to change my life. I got a reply and ended up emailing with a guy who basically said I didn&#8217;t have any experience making things. <em>Make things.</em> We had an ice storm and I remember taking care of stuff in the horticulture building because nobody else could get there, and I realized I was only really happy when I was making things but I had no idea how to go about doing it.</p>
<p>The way I was raised, vocational trades were for lesser students who couldn&#8217;t make it in university. I was also raised to believe that the first time you made a thing would tell you if you had a talent for it. So if the first thing you made was crap, clearly you weren&#8217;t made for this thing and you should try other things.</p>
<p>(This is basically why I&#8217;m so virulently opposed to the idea of talent. For the wide swath of people who are trying things, I think you can become good at anything you put the time, energy, and active thought into. The trick isn&#8217;t finding the thing you&#8217;re magically good at but finding the thing you wouldn&#8217;t mind spending a lifetime getting so good at that other people will pay you money for it.)</p>
<img src="/images/toc/snowstorm.png">
<p>So we had the ice storm and I had my epiphany. I tried to sign up for welding in January because welding could lead to airplane work but the equipment cost too much money so I went for forestry, figuring at least it&#8217;d be something hands-on, local, active, and I could work outdoors. I aced the classes but was checking out a book in the library and the librarian asked why in the world I&#8217;d want that book &#8212; so I realized I hated everyone and everything, and I did what the previous cadet commanders of our squadron had done and darkened the door of the Marine recruiter.</p>
<p>This is basically what my room looked like when I left.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/room.png">
<p>I shipped to Parris Island in July 2004 and spent three months in boot camp. Hurricane Ivan had just ripped through <span class="caps">NAS</span> Pensacola so we went on over to Camp Geiger for combat training and then all the aircraft mechanics and electricians got sent to New River for on-the-job training. I got attached to the airframe shop of a CH-53 training squadron and the Gunny promptly signed off two weeks of leave because training Pensacola would take a year so I wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to use it. I went home for Christmas.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/new-river.png">
<p>This was the first of the giant train trips. I took the train to Greensboro and up to Chicago, then west via the Empire Builder. Being constantly stressed to keep moving and building and making and doing, I fell in love with the feeling of being able to sit still, reading or relaxing, while moving for days through the world.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/ebuilder.png">
<p>I went on to Pensacola and got classed up as an aircraft electrician, which is AE in the Navy and 6432 in the Marines. It was just class work and working out. I hurt my feet in boot camp from overuse and I struggled in Pensacola with the PT. I think if I could do it again, I&#8217;d stay in the pool longer and get a plan for rehab and not class up until I was 100% &#8212; but I was in the Marines in part because I couldn&#8217;t think calmly, couldn&#8217;t plan, couldn&#8217;t just stop moving and take my bearings. I couldn&#8217;t make good decisions.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/pensacola.png">
<p>I reported to Cherry Point, where I got a weekend off and went up to DC on leave to see the sights. I felt like part of something, visiting the war memorials and seeing other veterans, in a deeper way that I hadn&#8217;t when I was laying the Challenger wreath at Arlington with the Con Law team in high school.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/vetswall.png">
<p>I reported to Yuma, Arizona, in 2005 &#8212; about a year after enlisting in the Marines. I had already cold called the local <span class="caps">EAA</span> chapter leader so I started going to meetings and hanging around the airport. Yuma is a mixed-use military/civilian field that can see United flights, AV8-B Harrier jets, and little RV-9s in the pattern. This group of pilots was so great to me, this is the first time when I finally started to calm down and chill out.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/yuma.png">
<p>I knew I was deploying to Iraq in February so I took two weeks and went to Switzerland with my dad for Christmas. I got to see my grandma for the last time and I was able to connect with my grandfather and my cousin, both of whom were military. There was a lot from this trip that stood out, but one part was my grandfather pulling out all of his shooting medals.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/medals.png">
<p>Looking back, this is one of the places where I took plenty of &#8216;for posterity&#8217; photos but I took some time out for &#8216;art&#8217; photos, where I stopped and looked at something, composed it, considered the light and exposure, and felt the photo meant something. My grandparents lived in Bern so we would walk along the river Aare and there&#8217;s always great graffiti.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/graffiti.png">
<p>I deployed to Iraq with <span class="caps">VMA</span>-513 in February of 2006 for seven months. I ended up handling hazmat for all the Marine air squadrons on Al Asad airbase. Again, more responsibility, more experience. I appreciate that the Marines give their lance corporals so much autonomy. We get the &#8220;commander&#8217;s intent&#8221; and then, if our staff NCOs are good &#8212; and mine were &#8212; then mostly we just get the job done in creative and improvised ways, knowing we have support.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/iraq.png">
<p>I took a month of leave when I got back and flew to Denver to visit some friends&#8230; and then took the train to Chicago, Cleveland, Boston, Toronto, and finally west to Vancouver, BC, on the <em>Canadian</em>, finishing off down to Portland. I spent a couple of nights in Neskowin on the Oregon Coast to round it off.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/canadian.png">
<p>Back in Yuma, I earned my corporal stripes and got certified as an inspector. I used my Iraq savings on a used truck and a pilot&#8217;s license &#8212; but I also got a scholarship from Peggy Ogram, a great lady who was involved in the flying community down there, who paid $2000 towards my license. I got to meet a great group of Ninety-Nines as well, and it meant a lot to realize that I learned to fly at the Somerton Airport where _________ got her license.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/somerton.png">
<p>I did a lot of traveling, exploring. They always said never to volunteer but I always volunteered. Even if it  turned out bad, which it rarely did, at least it was some new experience. I think this is one of the best things I did &#8212; now that I have a full time job in 2013, I don&#8217;t have the urge to travel. I can focus on work and not feel like I&#8217;m missing something. I&#8217;ve done <em>a lot</em>. Like this &#8212; randomly going out to Beale <span class="caps">AFB</span> to see the Global Hawk with a group of Ninety-Nines.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/globalhawk.png">
<p>I deployed again in November of 2007 on the <span class="caps">USS</span> Tarawa for her last West Pacific cruise before she was decommissioned. We were at sea for seven months and I got to see a chunk of the world; we went to the Persian Gulf via Singapore, the Strait of Malacca, and Bangladesh; in the Gulf we stopped in Dubai and Bahrain; we went south to the horn of Africa to put infantry ashore at Djibouti and to patrol the Gulf of Aden in support of antipiracy efforts off Somalia; and on our return, we went south to Perth in Western Australia and Hobart in Tasmania.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/usstarawa.png">
<p>I lived off-base with a good friend when I got home. I bought a couple of cats from the Humane Society, made sergeant, successfully lobbied for a night crew, had ankle surgery, and finally got out in 2009 at the end of my contract. I left the cats with my friend and took three months off to backpack solo around Europe.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/paris.png">
<p>In retrospect, I went a little crazy on that trip. I just couldn&#8217;t stop moving. In part it&#8217;s tough for anyone to get out of the service, especially one where you&#8217;re as groupthink-inducted as in the Marines, but I think also that what I wanted to do and what I thought were at odds with what I was still being told &#8212; and I was coming home, returning to that toxic environment. I wanted to be on good terms with my parents, but that was basically the only reason to come here.</p>
<p>I tried really hard while I was in to do all the things I was supposed to do, and I really feel as if they&#8217;ve only served me in ways that are bullshit. They never served me in the real ways of real knowledge and experience. I earned a certificate from Embry-Riddle in Aircraft Maintenance in preparation for my Airframes and Powerplants license, which I never managed to get, but I did log 8,000 hours and get my aircraft electrician journeyman&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>I ended up finishing my Bachelor&#8217;s in Engineering Technology from Old Dominion and I debated as I got out of the Corps whether to pursue a Master&#8217;s at Portland State or at the University of Arizona. I went for Portland State because it&#8217;s home and I missed Oregon. I loaded up the truck and headed home.</p>
<img src="/images/toc/homeward.png">
<p>I lived with my dad for a couple of months in Salem and then moved into downtown Portland to start at Portland State in January of 2010. It took two years of postbac and two years of grad courses to earn my Master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p>I joined the sysadmin Braindump in 2011, which hugely improved my Linux/Unix skills, and at some point got involved in the aerospace society, which improved my rocket and hardware design skills, and somehow ended up managing an open technology lab and hanging around with computer scientists.</p>
<p>I have a lot of problems with the very white, male, moneyed class of Silicon Valley tech startups because I ran into a lot of that in the Braindump crowd. Portland has a great tech scene but there are some troubling philosophical underpinnings that don&#8217;t appreciate the range of life experience of people. That said, Portland&#8217;s tech scene is about making things and it&#8217;s only been in the last couple of years that I got into open source tech and rapid prototyping and <em>making things</em> which come with a bonus of <em>and learning from them</em>.</p>
<p>I got an internship at Insitu, a Boeing-owned drone manufacturer in 2012, which was a great experience.</p>
<p>I went back to Switzerland for Christmas in 2012 and was lucky enough when I got back to land an awesome job as an electrical engineer at a local company that makes enhanced vision systems &#8211; basically IR/visible blended cameras for aircraft. I get to do design work on hardware, hardware languages, and software with a boss who&#8217;s also a good mentor. I started reading about mindfulness, mappers vs packers, software engineering, and the neurochemical effects of my caffeine and sugar addictions.</p>
<p>As an example of the modeling, I&#8217;ve found that, no, it&#8217;s really me, I really can&#8217;t learn in a classroom setting. I need an iterative, contextual, hands-on, project-driven learning environment&#8230; which is exactly what my job is, thankfully. There are things I know I&#8217;ve been taught in school but that I couldn&#8217;t retain, that when I suggest something and my boss just looks at me and says, go try it, and I try it, and of course there&#8217;s just no way it would have worked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like saying <em>this backpack is in the way. I&#8217;m going to just store this backpack by the wall, four feet off the ground, in mid-air.</em> sure, sure. go try that. And when I get there, I realize to my chagrin that I&#8217;ve forgotten to account for gravity. So I duck back in the office and say &#8212; well, that didn&#8217;t work, but here&#8217;s what I think could work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some questions I ask myself these days are</p>
<p>- What can I make that&#8217;s a contribution to the world?</p>
<p>- What is the point of this photo that I&#8217;m about to take?</p>
<p>- What are the ways I can be better at mindfulness?</p>
<p>- Is that object climbable?</p>
<p>- How can I improve my mental models?</p>
<p>- Where is the place that fascinates me that I could visit this year?</p>
