  <div class="title">MATE ROV Competition</div>
  <p>August 2011 - Portland, Oregon</p>

  <p>The Marine Advanced Technology Education (<span class="caps">MATE</span>) Center in Monterey Bay coordinates an annual international robotics competition open to student teams of all academic levels from elementary schools to university. <span class="caps">MATE</span> designs a new underwater obstacle course consisting of mission tasks to be navigated and completed by a tethered underwater vehicle remotely-operated from a driver station on the surface. Missions are chosen to imitate real-world events in ROVs and judges are solicited from oceanography and commercial <span class="caps">ROV</span> companies.</p>
<div align="center"> <img src="/images/project/underwater/figure5.gif"></div>
<p>K-12 teams (Scout and Ranger class) are required to compete at regional competitions. The winner from each attends the international competition. University teams are only required to attend regionals to demonstrate safety awareness and the ability to maneuver in the water. There are twenty regional competitions in the world; the five non-U.S. locations are in Scotland, Hong Kong, Japan, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The Lincoln High School robotics team has competed in this competition since 2008, when they won the Pacific Northwest regional and took fourth place in the international competition at University of California San Diego.</p>
<p>I joined the team as the assistant coach in 2010 and attended the Northwest regional in 2010 and 2011. The team is very self-directed so coaches and mentors were mostly there to give advice. The team I ended up supporting the most with project management, organization, programming, and electronics was the junior Sea Dawgs team with their bot, the <em>Sea Pup</em>.</p>
<div align="center"> <img src="/images/project/mate-bots/sea-pup.png"></div>
<p>The students received the mission in December and designed the entire underwater vehicle by May when they went to Federal Way. The design decisions usually came down to simplicity and cost. The frame was <span class="caps">PVC</span> with a mesh-floored center to scoop up the gummy &#8216;crustaceans&#8217;. The bot was made neutrally buoyant by attaching styrofoam and empty water bottles. The vertical maneuvering was pneumatic tubing fed down the tether into duct-taped ziploc bags attached to the frame. It was discovered that expensive Nalgene bottles were far superior to regular water bottles, which crushed under the pressure of fifteen feet of water, but filling the ziploc bags with air was a surprisingly effective solution.</p>
<p>All the electronics were kept on the surface and the underwater cameras we used were manufactured for the purpose so we avoided issues of waterproofing. The lengths to which the team went to avoid programming was impressive. They solved the lateral maneuvering problem with a brilliantly simple solution: two rocker switches that corresponded to one modified bilge pump on each corner of the frame. Rocking both switches forward activated the two rear-facing pumps and pushed the bot forward; rocking them both back activated the two in front and pushed the bot to the rear.</p>
<p>Alternating the forward-left and rear-right made the bot turn to the left and vice-versa for turning the bot to the right. The system had the advantage of being intuitive for the pilot.</p>
<p>Because of this aversity to coding and limited experience with <span class="caps">CAD</span>, most of the missions were impossible for the bot to accomplish &#8212; but this was a common theme across all the teams at the high school level. No team successfully recovered agar and, like our team, several tried the route of attaching various analog sensors in view of the underwater cameras. The inevitable visibility problems were enough to convince several frustrated students to give coding a try. Our team did have a hydrophone for finding a &#8220;rumbling sea vent&#8221; and we were able to make a temperature graph by hovering by different vents and checking a meat thermometer, but this is a still captured from one of the cameras showing their gummy crustacean catch that shows what kind of view they were up against.</p>
<div align="center"> <img src="/images/project/mate-bots/visibility.png"></div>
<p>In retrospect, the biggest assumption that prevented the Sea Pup from success was that of &#8220;what an underwater robot ought to look like&#8221;. As proto-engineers, they just hadn&#8217;t developed the staying power to compare multiple potential ideas. They would grab one idea and never look back. In comparison, the senior bot below was able to simultaneously look more polished and handle more of the missions. That the senior team had three years experience was clear in all aspects of their design and build process. They assumed a lot less in the earlier stages and built much faster, to have more time testing and reworking. They were much more on the path to rapid prototyping, they were more flexible as to what skills they would need, and they could bounce back from failure.</p>
<div align="center"> <img src="/images/project/mate-bots/senior-bot.png"></div>
<p>I hugely recommend the competition for high school robotics programs. The experience of seven months designing, building, and testing an underwater bot, which brings unique problems to remotely controlled vehicles, turned out to be immensely rewarding for our students. Most of the team came away wanting to major in engineering in college and all of them took away lessons for all sorts of future projects.</p>
