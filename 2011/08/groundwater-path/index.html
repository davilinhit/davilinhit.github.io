  <div class="title">Likely Groundwater Path Analysis</div>
  <p>August 2011 - Portland State University</p>

  <p>This was another project in my computer-based physical geology lab at Portland State. We were given a map of five potential farm sites near Umatilla, Oregon, and told to use ArcGIS to determine based on bedrock permeability, porosity, and slope which farm location would be better-suited in case of a chemical spill at either local munitions bunker.</p>
<p>The study area is south of the city of Umatilla, Oregon. The four main rock types present on the land of the proposed farms, as shown in Figure 1, are as follows: glaciofluvial, lacustrine, and pediment sedimentary deposits (Qgs) from the Pleistocene; Wanapum basalt (Tcw) from the middle Miocene; Loess (Ql) from the Holocene and Pleistocene; and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks and tuff (Ts) from the Pliocene and Miocene.</p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/project/geolab/spillanalysis-1.png"></div>
<p>Figure 2 shows the potentiometric map. If the chemical weapons release did occur from Bunker One, the contamination would likely travel to the northeast (10°) and to the southwest (250°). The northeast flow would be routed directly to Farm 3 and then Farm 1, and contaminate the sedimentary deposits (Qgs) which make up the larger aquifer there.</p>
<p>If the weapons release occurred from Bunker Two, the contamination would likely travel to the northwest (325°) directly into the path of Farm 5. As Farm 2 is somewhat far away from Bunker Two, it is at somewhat lower risk for contamination. The flow would take a longer period of time to affect the very local groundwater, long enough that other farms would be affected first and farmers may win a lawsuit so they can move somewhere else.</p>
<p>Farm 4 is the likely candidate to avoid the concern of spill completely, the water table being at higher elevation than the contamination sources, and has the added bonus of being situated on loess (Ql) which is an excellent aquifer material because it contains local interbedded layers of soil, caliche, and water-laid silt and gravel. Farm 4 is the most attractive location, with Farm 2 a close second. Farm 1 is at greater distance from a potential spill but will eventually be severely affected. Farms 3 and 5 are in immediate danger.</p>
