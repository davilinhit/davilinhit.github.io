So the idea is to blog every day for the eight weeks of summer school. I promised myself I'd write about whatever I wanted. What do I settle on nearly immediately? How much I don't feel worthy, like I'm deceiving myself, like any day now somebody's gonna come by and say <em>oh, hey, we're sorry but there's been a huge mistake and we're gonna have to ask you to leave.</em>

I feel stupid for admitting to that feeling; writing about it in detail just feels like whining.
