description: Updating the previous controller.

I worked with Tung as part of the ME capstone team at Portland State to update the oven controller Arduino shield I made last week. Tung had already updated the Eagle schematic so this time for me it was just layout, routing, and basic soldering. I fixed the one via problem but then promptly made the same mistake on the other set of headers, so I delivered the board last night and it should work fine but the soldering was trickier than I'd like. 

I'm still so spoiled by having OSHPark. The only Gerbers I give our lab's LPKF router are the Top Layer, Bottom Layer, Board Outline, and Unplated Drill. No silkscreen. I could solder mask but I haven't. Maybe next time. I used materials and headers I had on hand but even through OSHPark it'd be just under $30 for three boards.

Here are the schematic, layout, and final photos. Eagle files are on the <a href="http://github.com/wicker/oven-controller/">Github repo</a>.
