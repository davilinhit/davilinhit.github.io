The <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/cecs/innovation-program">Engineering Innovation Program at Portland State</a> accepts student proposals on a quarterly basis and funds successful proposals at first $1,000 and then $3,000. The program also offers mentoring, a place to work, and tools. The program expects its participants to attend the Innovation Program's annual poster presentations in November.

We displayed both our poster and our quadcopter in November 2011. (<a href="/img/project/avtposter/avtposter.pdf">PDF</a>)
