Walking around in photographs is just another facet of thinking in pictures.

I love photography. I've been more interested in the effect of the final product than the technical aspects of taking the picture. Photos are records of actual places that actually existed. It blows my mind that a photo is actually the way it looked to the artist who took the picture.

Some times I'll see a photo and think nothing but <em>wow, that's a cool object, that's great composition, what a neat picture.</em> That's just about all I was thinking about when I took pictures of the Dale Chihuly glass art exhibit at the Phoenix Botanical Garden. <em>How can I capture this?</em>

On other days, I'll be overwhelmingly aware of the artist, the photographer, and of their perspective. They stood there, in the desert or the forest or whatever, and something they saw deemed it worthy of capturing for later -- and whatever aspect that drove them to compose the shot is preserved in that photograph. I'll think <em>wow, photographer, <u>you</u> stood right there and took that shot.</em> It'll be like I walked right into the picture myself.

That's the perspective I have when I revisit my own photography. I remember what it was like to spend a morning in that Phoenix garden: walking up and down the winding paths for hours, watching the glass sculptures change as the sun rose, crouching to get a particular shot. The travel photos are uploaded here as much for me as for my friends and random passersby.

The first time I was keenly aware of that second perspective with paintings was at an exhibit of Van Gogh in Basel. A lot of his early paintings, I felt like I was standing there looking at it in the gallery but my brain-self had left my body and gone to walk around in the space he'd evoked. I liked it.
