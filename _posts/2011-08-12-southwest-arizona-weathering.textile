I lived in Yuma, Arizona, for four years and I did a lot of flying. I would drive and read the Roadside Geology of Arizona but I never thought to ask about the bigger picture until I got to Portland and enrolled in the geology program.

The eastern part of Arizona is part of the Colorado Plateau; the escarpment, or steep drop-off, that leads down to the desert in the south and west is called teh Mogollon Rim. The floor of the desert below the Mogollon Rim includes the cities of high desert Tucson and low desert Yuma. This lower region is part of the Basin and Range region of North America that's characterized by flat valleys between seemingly random outcroppings of rock pushed up by the constant extending of the bedrock, causing weak points through which underlying volcanic material can push up to the surface.

On the map, they look like this:

Why do these ranges look the way they do? They're made of granite and they're 'volcanic intrusions' pushed up from deep in the earth so they break through the crust.

The rain pouring down on the mountains washes out loose soil into vast floodplains called alluvial fans.

Several processes are occurring simultaneously. The granite mountains are being pushed up from below and erosion simultaneous moves sediment down to the valleys, which can be many feet of packed sand between surface and bedrock.

The valley fill caused by erosion is called pediment by scientists and 'bajada' locally.

It's hard to explain an Arizona sandstorm to someone who hasn't experienced one. Sandstorms can rip paint off cars.

The result can be nicely rounded, smoothed rock formations.

And then there's the "chocolate drop" which is a distinctive shape and color. It's actually a dike, an igneous extrusion that comes from the same material that forms the "chocolate mountains" several miles north of Yuma.

A weakness in the crust to the south allowed a small amount of igneous material, under tremendous force, to split away south and make a new path until it pushed through the surface.

It also shows the effects of weathering and of desert life, accustomed to harsh conditions, growing right up to its edges.
