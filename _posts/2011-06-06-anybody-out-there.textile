The term's nearly over so I'm at the point where I'm equal parts nostalgic and procrastinating. I used to blog in high school and I miss it. I take a lot of pictures and they sit on my hard drive where nobody ever sees them. I could upload them all to Flickr or Picasa but that'd be several weeks of work and nobody'd ever see them there.

I've been looking for engineering blogs, particularly student engineers who fly on the side, but I think they're too busy flying or making things. I realized I haven't built anything in months. I code and study and take exams but summer's coming in Oregon and I've got a flight instructor lined up so I figure this'll be a way to hold myself accountable.

Somebody else is out there, right?
