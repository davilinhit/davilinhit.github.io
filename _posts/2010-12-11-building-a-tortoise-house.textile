The tortoise belonged to my nephew for a few years but ended up needing another home so he came into my possession with a small aquarium. My cats loved taunting him, stressing him out, so I passed him on to my dad, who has a proper yard and was willing to keep him inside during the winter.

I think he's a Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise but I really haven't got the faintest clue about tortoise identification so you can't take my word for it. The important thing is that my great-grandma apparently had tortoises so my dad has some experience and, more importantly, the possible species for this guy all live in temperate climates. 

I came over one day and we put up this pen with some wood my dad had around. The sides are about a foot high and he's never attempted to climb over or tunnel under them. He's had no problems with predators as far as my dad can tell.

He doesn't do much but walk around all day, flattening a trail by the wall.

We cut a door in a plastic flat and flipped it upside down, covering it in some thick outdoor poster-board and flat rocks to keep the rain out.

He likes the expensive butter lettuce and plums best. My dad gets a kick out of him.

Everything must seem bigger.

The ground's uneven so we had to make a fix to make sure he wouldn't see daylight and dig, but the wooden sides don't go down more than a couple of inches.

I'm really tempted to stick a webcam to his shell and transmit a live feed for a couple days, then time-lapse the results. "The life of the tortoise."
