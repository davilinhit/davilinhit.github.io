This is my code for my personal site and blog, compendiarious.net, without images. I use A Small Orange for hosting. I've used a couple of plugins from other people but the template and CSS are mine.

WHAT'S INCLUDED HERE?

Everything related to my website: over a hundred files. 

CREDIT

Jekyll was created by Tom Preston-Warner at Github.

An excellent walkthrough at Vito Botta.

Dave Perrett's Jekyll tag page generator is awesome.

MY PLAN

I'd like to automate the process of uploading to my host (asmallorange.com).

The current process involves running jekyll locally and manually uploading via SSH.
