  <div class="title">Oven Control Board v1</div>
  <p>January 2014 - Portland, Oregon</p>

  <p>An ME capstone team at Portland State is working on an oven so we can cure our own composites. It&#8217;s awesome. This oven control board was a five-day project that came out of nowhere this week on Tuesday and which I delivered on Sunday.</p>
<p>Tung, their electrical person, already had the design figured out and working with breadboard components and an Arduino. What he really wanted was an Arduino shield so we met, looked at what he had, and figured out how we&#8217;d put it on the right footprint. This is the first time I&#8217;d been able to sit with someone who was new to Eagle and really explain what makes a decent schematic, so it&#8217;s pretty cool to see how much I&#8217;ve learned in just a couple of years.</p>
<img src="/images/project/oven-control-board/ovenboard-schema.png">
<p>The layout was constrained by the shield but even moreso by our plan to use the <span class="caps">LPKF</span> router. It had to be a two-layer board that didn&#8217;t have plated through-holes or vias. I managed to put all the traces except one on the bottom layer because all the components get soldered on the bottom side (they&#8217;re all through-hole) and then I just made that a much wider polygon fill and dropped vias to get the top-trace signal connected down below.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Arduino shields sit on top of the Arduino so I had to drop an extra via on each pad of the 0.1&quot; headers so copper wire could be slid through and squashed, essentially plating them myself.</p>

<p>The final product doesn&#8217;t look too shabby. Well, I take that back &#8212; the isolation on the <span class="caps">LPKF</span> is so tiny (even at the double-width!) that I&#8217;m terrified of putting too much solder on each pin and shorting it outside the pad. This is really crappy soldering but I ohmed everything out so electrically the joints are fine.</p>
<p>Definitely I&#8217;ve been spoiled with OSHPark and $5/sq in board with plated through-holes and solder mask.</p>
<p>The libraries and everything are all up in the <a href="https://github.com/wicker/oven-controller">oven-controller Github repo</a>.</p>
