          <div class="title">Hobby electronics in Portland</div>
  <p>August 2013 - Portland, Oregon</p>

  <p>A technician at work recently asked me about getting started making stuff in Portland and in general so I braindumped into an email. I’ve cleaned up and added a lot before posting it here. These are only things I’ve actively been to or seen, which means there’s a whole city of awesome out there.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>First off, Portland is pretty awesome and it&#8217;s got an awesome calendar. Keep an eye on <a href="http://calagator.org/">Calagator</a>, the Portland Tech calendar.</p>
<p>You might want to get a <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> account. Feel free to follow &#8216;wicker&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you have a Monday evening free, all kinds of electronics hackers bring their projects to <a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/">Dorkbot</a> on every other Monday at Backspace Café in downtown Portland.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://psu-epl.github.io">Electronics Prototyping Lab</a> at Portland State has walk-in lab hours to use their laser cutter, 3D printer, <span class="caps">LPKF</span> board router, soldering stations, and reflow oven.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the <a href="http://pdxdrones.com">PDXDrones</a> group with a monthly fly-out and invited speakers as well as the <a href="http://psas.pdx.edu">Portland State Aerospace Society</a> building rockets and related avionics every Tuesday night on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned a ton about how computers, electronics, and networking works by being able to look under the hood of my laptop.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not comfortable with dual-booting your current laptop, where you add Linux alongside your current operating system and choose one every time you boot up, then I suggest buying a second-hand laptop running Ubuntu Linux from <a href="http://freegeek.org">FreeGeek</a>&#8217;s thrift shop on SE Hawthorne. They run a couple hundred dollars and you’re supporting a great cause, but if that’s too steep you can also volunteer in their Build Program to earn your own.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint</a>, or whatever brand of Linux you prefer, get set up with <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys and be able to clone git repositories from GitHub. Read all the <a href="http://help.github.com">GitHub help documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Looking around GitHub, you&#8217;ll find the same two files over and over. One is <span class="caps">README</span> and by looking you&#8217;ll see what should be in a good <span class="caps">README</span> and what&#8217;s lacking in the bad ones. The other is a <span class="caps">LICENSE</span> file and this is where you&#8217;ll tell other developers what you do and don&#8217;t want them to do with your code.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Licenses</strong></p>
<p>I feel strongly that one of the great things about the electronics maker community is in being very pro-open source where source code and hardware schematics are made freely available. I don&#8217;t just want to know what you made, I want to know how you made it.</p>
<p>I do want to note that there are a vocal crowd out there that says <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">all software should be free</a>. Do them the favor of reading up on their points of view and adjust your philosophy accordingly. Then realize that the way things are right now is really <a href="http://opensource.org/">open source</a> instead, where you choose a license that allows others to use your code and schematics but limit them to obey certain conditions.</p>
<p>You can read up on <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">the current open source licenses</a> and pick one that you like. LadyAda has an intro to <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/library/openhardware/license.html">open hardware licenses</a>, which is something that&#8217;s still evolving.</p>
<p>I tend to license my hardware and software under the 3-clause <span class="caps">BSD</span> license, which says you can take my work but you must include the copyright notice and my name whether you&#8217;re releasing (a) my source code or (b) a compiled binary, and &#169; you can&#8217;t use my name or the name of my orgnaization to endorse or promote products you make by changing my software.</p>
<p><strong>Make Your Own Boards</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s typical to start out with a breadboard but pretty soon you&#8217;re going to want something a little more durable. Also, you&#8217;ll want to put the project up on a shelf and re-use that breadboard.</p>
<p>Make your own boards by designing your circuit and laying out the traces on your own circuit board in a schematic/board layout editor using <a href="http://cadsoftusa.com">Eagle</a> or <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org">KiCad</a>. You’ll probably want to start with 2-layer boards so don’t pay money for the standard version of Eagle until you&#8217;re absolutely sure you want it. The hobby version lets you build small 2-layer boards for free.</p>
<p>I recommend not starting out on Eagle but, if you feel you must, don&#8217;t think you can&#8217;t switch later. Any good open source schematics editor will open Eagle files. I started out with Eagle, got the standard Eagle, and while I like the program, I got somebody else to pay for it and would not have paid for it myself. Plus it&#8217;s closed source, I was never able to get a copy of the license, and their customer service is nonexistent.</p>
<p>Get your board fabbed locally for $5/sq inch through <a href="http://oshpark.com/">OSHPark</a> by ordering online, uploading your <span class="caps">CAD</span> files, and getting it mailed to your house in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>When you’re designing the board, figure out your bill of materials using <a href="http://digikey.com">Digikey</a>, <a href="http://mouser.com">Mouser</a>, <a href="http://newark.com">Newark</a>, <a href="http://sparkfun.com">Sparkfun</a>, and <a href="http://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>.</p>
<p>Always order the parts when you order the board to be sure everything&#8217;s in stock. Double check your packages and footprints so the parts you order will fit your board!</p>
<p>Digikey tip: order it <span class="caps">USPS</span> regular shipping, you generally get it in like two days for $5. Consider overnight shipping a last resort.</p>
<p>Are you completely lost and confused when it comes to laying or building boards? The <a href="http://psu-epl.github.io">Electronics Prototyping Lab</a> at Portland State has a calendar of open lab walk-in hours.</p>
<p>For local parts retailers, make the pilgrimage to <a href="http://www.oregon-electronics.com">Oregon Electronics</a> in Beaverton, <a href="http://norvac.net">Norvac</a> in Salem, or <a href="http://www.frys.com/">Fry&#8217;s</a> in Wilsonville.</p>
<p>All the places above link you to the datasheet. Read every datasheet. Start to learn the words.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Development Platform</strong></p>
<p>For basic introduction to C on microcontrollers, you really can’t beat a basic <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>.</p>
<p>For <span class="caps">FPGA</span>, go with a <a href="http://papilio.cc">Papilio</a> kit or an <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/451">Altera DE0-Nano from Adafruit</a> and check out the <a href="http://fpga4fun.com">FPGA4Fun</a> for a place to start.</p>
<p>There are a great set of introductory tutorial systems at <a href="http://learn.sparkfun.com">Learn at SparkFun</a> and <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com">Adafruit Learning</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve maxed out your Arduino, move on to a <a href="http://beagleboard.org">Beagleboard</a> or <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Two common, beginner-friendly embedded operating systems are the <a href="http://ros.org/wiki">Robot Operating System</a> and <a href="http://www.chibios.org">ChibiOS</a>.</p>
<p>For fun project ideas and community, check out <a href="http://makezine.com">Make Magazine</a> and the <a href="http://hackaday.com">Hackaday Blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Code</strong></p>
<p>Need to learn a new language or framework? Pick a language, find a challenge, start writing code, and commit commit commit. Your early code can be terrible. One of the best ways to get good is to write a lot of code, write mountains of code, and keep it so you can look back and learn from it.</p>
<p>For example, I chose C and wrote a bunch of simple solutions for <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>.</p>
<p>Jennifer DeWalt is learning website front-end by building <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com">180 Websites in 180 Days</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve done some random projects, get more systematic.</p>
<p>Try to do a project for each protocol, from I2C to <span class="caps">SPI</span> to serial.</p>
<p>Read all the Wikipedia pages and be able to draw the different protocol timing diagram shapes.</p>
<p>Learn when and when not to use each. Start to learn what physically works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Ask not only ‘what is this unfamiliar term?’ but also ‘what are its alternatives?’.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jacquesricher.com/NEETS/">Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series</a> is available for free.</p>
<p>One place for explanations/answers is the <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com">Electronics StackExchange</a>.</p>
