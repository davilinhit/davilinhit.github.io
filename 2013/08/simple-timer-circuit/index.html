          <p><strong>Building and GIFing a timer circuit</strong><br />
  August 2013 - Portland State University</p>

  <p>Just screwing around with circuits.</p>
<p>I recently bought a house and set up a little home office. In the process, I found a bunch of through-hole components that I got from parts unknown and ended up sorting and messing around with them. All of this high-level ChibiOS stuff has been stressing me out so I did something I haven&#8217;t done in maybe forever &#8212; made a bunch of little circuits for the hell of it.</p>
<p>By the way, Parts Unknown would be an awesome name for an electronics component business.</p>
<img src="/images/project/blinky/IMG_0187.png">
<p>The first question I asked was hey, does this potentiometer work? Do these LEDs? It&#8217;s a three-pin pot powered off a 9V with output voltage over the <span class="caps">LED</span>.</p>
<img src="/images/project/blinky/IMG_0194a.png">
<p>I wanted some sort of switch to turn off all power without having to keep unsnapping the 9V header but all I could come up with in my box of parts was a 8-pin switch.</p>
<p>I went through all my through-hole ICs and found that I&#8217;ve accumulated all the usual: logic gates, comparators, muxes, op amps&#8230; and 555 timers, which I know of but have never actually used.</p>
<p>I used a schematic from Forrest Mims&#8217; 555 Timer cookbook and wired it up. Then I looked into how to make a gif to post here so it&#8217;s clear the light is blinking. I figured ffmpeg would work but it&#8217;s got a note that this feature is deprecated and to use avconv instead. I tried with ffmpeg anyway and got a 141 MB file.</p>
<p>I went looking for better instructions and found <a href="https://scottlinux.com/2011/07/31/create-animated-gif-in-linux-from-command-line/">Scott&#8217;s Linux blog</a>.</p>
<p>I took the picture with an iPhone 4S and used avconv to grab a photo every second. That gave me four still iamges to put into the gif.</p>
<p><code>avconv -i IMG_0196.MOV -vsync 1 -r 1 -an -y 'frame%d.jpg'</code></p>
<p>Then I used Scott&#8217;s instructions to make what turned out to be a pretty crappy gif, through no fault of his.</p>
<p><code>mogrify -resize 640x480 *.jpg</code></p>
<p><code>convert -delay 20 -loop 0 *.jpg 555blink.gif</code></p>
<img src="/images/project/blinky/555blink1.gif">
<p>Lesson learned: I need a camera tripod and also to automate this process. I looked around and found another movie that was much longer, so I repeated the process and took the first eight frames.</p>
<img src="/images/project/blinky/555blink2.gif">
<p><code> mogrify -resize 640x480 *.jpg</p>
<p>convert -delay 30 -loop 0 *.jpg 555blink1.gif</p>
<p>avconv -i IMG_0196.<span class="caps">MOV</span> -vsync 1 -r 2 -an -y &#8216;frame%d.jpg&#8217;</code></p>
<p>I should probably have taken twice as many frames per second in the avconv process because it doesn&#8217;t show that the light should be on the same amount of time each blink. So I did that on the longer movie and ended up selecting the first 10 frames in the sequence, which includes two cycles of the blinking <span class="caps">LED</span>.</p>
<img src="/images/project/blinky/555blink3.gif">
<p>I kept going for the hell of it, since I had 8 switches to work with. I added a little push-button switch to turn on the <span class="caps">LED</span> on the button press. Having both hooked up at the same time meant the <span class="caps">LED</span> up top was blinking as per the 555 timer but pressing the button down below sunk all current through the bottom <span class="caps">LED</span>.</p>
<img src="/images/project/blinky/IMG_0199.png">
<p>It seems like it&#8217;d be pretty easy to fake a <span class="caps">GIF</span>, to do sleight of hand, and to demonstrate performance or meeting a spec that isn&#8217;t actually there. This last gif is the longest, the largest, with 2fps to pull the still images, but it&#8217;s still not anywhere near acceptable.</p>
<p>Kind of a cool thing to think about.</p>
