<p>The Open Tech Lab just bought an <span class="caps">IMEX</span> Firefox brushed 1/10th RC truck. I want to make an autonomous RC car that can be a vision testing platform for our quadcopter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m calling this project the Foxcar.</p>
<img src="/img/project/foxcar/IMG_0385.png">
<p>I opened up the truck to see if I could solder my Raspberry Pi directly to the motor controller board but there were a couple chips I couldn&#8217;t identify, one of which looked like the microcontroller, so I decided to rip the guts out and replace them with my own electronics.</p>
<img src="/img/project/foxcar/IMEXBoard.png">
<p>The Firefox has a single DC RC 550 motor and a 5-wire servo, running on a single 7.6V NiMH 1800 mAh battery. Probably this means the motor is a 6V motor. The parts were:</p>
<p>1x AT1206 74C02N 8-pin <span class="caps">DIP</span> Probably a Quad 2-input <span class="caps">NAND</span>, <span class="caps">NOR</span>, or Hex Inverter<br />
6x 531 T70 3-pin 72 A 25V N-channel Power MOSFETs. <br />
1x MC34063 8-pin <span class="caps">DIP</span> 1.5A Inverted Switching Regulator which is for the DC-DC converters. <br />
1x D1116 16-pin <span class="caps">DIP</span> unknown<br />
1x LM339L 14-pin <span class="caps">DIP</span> Quad-Differential Comparator<br />
1x AMP26002 25-pin square unknown<br />
1x MX117 8-pin <span class="caps">DIP</span> Electric Toy DC Motor Drive Circuit H-Bridge Drive</p>
<p>I took a good look at the configuration of the car. I didn&#8217;t want to replace the motor unless I had to, but the servo had to go.</p>
<img src="/img/project/foxcar/IMG_0377.png">
<p>This is the board. I was surprised that the antenna is just a long piece of wire tucked up inside the antenna cover. The car ran great when I tested it back before I tore it apart. Hopefully it&#8217;ll work great after it&#8217;s all put back together&#8230;</p>
<img src="/img/project/foxcar/IMG_0384.png">
<p>I already had an Adafruit Motor Shield and an Arduino. I hooked up a 6V DC motor and a 3-wire servo just to be sure it worked. I swapped servos on the car and hooked up the Arduino.</p>
<img src="/img/project/foxcar/IMG_0380.png">
<p>My other 6V DC motor ran happily on the Adafruit example sketch but this motor just clicks in one direction or the other. I tried swapping the red and black wires (though it&#8217;s bi-directional, so not sure why that would make a difference) and I checked to be sure it has the three capacitors soldered to the motor itself for noise control.</p>
<p>So figuring out the DC motor is the next piece. My three-wire servo works great, though.</p>
