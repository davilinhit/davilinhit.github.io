  <p>I wrote a nice, long note last night but with today&#8217;s date about my process for designing PCBs and then blew it away this morning by running the makenote script for today. Argh. Well, it had occurred to me that I should add a line to the makenote script to prompt me about the overwrite if a post already exists.</p>
<p>It turns out that&#8217;s as easy as adding -i to the cp command and, as a bonus, if I tell it &#8216;n&#8217; (I don&#8217;t want it to overwrite) then the script executes the next line which is opening the file so I can edit. I can live with that.</p>
<p>A couple random notes about sed to add at the beginning and end of a line:</p>
<p><code>s/$/text/</code><br />
<code>s/^/text/</code></p>
<p>In other news, I came across <a href="http://www.davehylands.com/Wood-Working/Electronics-Workbench/">Dave Hyland&#8217;s Electronics Workbench</a> via StackExchange because I&#8217;ve been inventorying my piles of components. I kind of want to do this as a SolidWorks project. I do have a closet in my office&#8230; I&#8217;ve been making a database on summerisle with an inventory of all the parts I have at home. I&#8217;m tired of trying to match them up. I&#8217;m going to get a trial of Illustrator and mock up an interface or something to drop on top of it, mostly because the Adobe stuff is so shiny.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been going through a ton of old photos and organizing all my photo albums on one hard drive. It&#8217;s pretty cool to look at photos I took in 2000 as a fifteen-year old. They&#8217;re mostly crap, but their value to me is mostly in memories so that&#8217;s all right.</p>
<p>The title photo from today is the first photo I took on the X100S back in June.</p>
<p>I did add several outdoor posts from last year, including <a href="/2013/08/tualatin-wildlife-refuge-evening/">Tualatin Wildlife Refuge</a>, <a href="/2012/09/dismal-nitch">Dismal Nitch</a>, <a href="/2012/08/badger-creek">Badger Creek</a>, and <a href="/2012/08/callahans-to-green-springs-inn">Callahan&#8217;s to Green Springs Inn</a>.</p>
<p>And I got the photos from Kalaloch up, which I had to take with my iPhone because I left my camera battery (!!!!!) in Portland. But it was gorgeous up there anyway, I just think the X100S would have given me more control over the light. The beach, ocean, and sky all turn the same sort of gray when it&#8217;s overcast.</p>
