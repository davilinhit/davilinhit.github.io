        <p>I&#8217;m trying keep a daily log of my reading, writing, rolling, and reflecting. No promises.</p>

  <p><a href="/2013/12/note"><strong>Friday, December 27 2013</strong></a></p>
  <p><p>Spent a couple days in a cabin at Kalaloch Lodge on the Olympic Peninsula. I edited some posts and got everything ready for when I get home to just push the site.</p>
<p>I have a couple interesting projects in the pipeline, including the RF board and an implementation of Timo Bergmann&#8217;s Sound of Sorting. I never had the algorithms class at school so writing fifteen sorts with the help of the Intro to Algorithms, 3rd Ed, has introduced me to a bunch of concepts &#8211; optimization among them.</p></p>

  <p><p>This note is trying out my new script. It first gets the current date in the right format.</p>
<p><code>NAME=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")</code></p>
<p>Then it copies a template I made in _layouts/ and names it using that date output.</p>
<p><code>cp $SRCDIR/_layouts/note_  .textile $SRCDIR/_posts/$NAME-note.textile</code></p>
<p>Then it opens it for editing so I can do my thing.</p>
<p><code>vim $SRCDIR/_posts/$NAME-note.textile</code></p>
<p>And here it is. Yay for lowering transaction costs.</p>
<p>I also figured out a way to add image to posts but they only show up on the notebook page, not the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> feed, because they&#8217;re slid in from the yaml header and sit above the title. They look nice so I&#8217;m calling it good.</p></p>

  <p><p>Hahahaha, and then I didn&#8217;t write at all again for three weeks.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the holiday and I&#8217;ve been hacking away at this Foxcar control board. I&#8217;ve started journaling in a real actual physical journal and I&#8217;ve found it helpful to not have an audience to worry about.</p>
<p>The RF front-end board schematic is done, though I&#8217;m still a little unhappy with the power section, but there&#8217;s another <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PSAS</span></span> member who&#8217;s working on a separate board that&#8217;s also set up for the same power source so if he arrives at a nicer solution before I get the layout finished (I&#8217;m starting from the RF side) then I&#8217;ll change my choice of chips.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m unhappy because the current switching power supply is a 60-pin <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LGA</span></span> so you can&#8217;t get to the traces once it&#8217;s been soldered to the board. I&#8217;m ordering the board through OSHPark then reflow it so probably everything will be fine but I still get worried about parts I only get one chance with.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s designed to handle 20V on the rocket Power over Ethernet bus so I guess you get what you pay for. I have a micro-<span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> connector for at-laptop debug.</p>
<p>Annnd the Foxcar control board schematic is done and I pushed to github. I started on the layout, started the trace calculations, and then reinstalled Starcraft II. I can&#8217;t stop thinking about playing it.  I think I might be slightly burned out&#8230;</p>
<p>Tonight I cleaned up little things on the website that were bothering me, including the Endurance Days part, and now I&#8217;m going to go home and hunt me some Zerg.</p></p>

  <p><p>Found Sumana&#8217;s blog this week and I keep returning to it. I&#8217;m afraid of writing the wrong thing and so I don&#8217;t write at all, but it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s this idea of what I&#8217;ll write and how I&#8217;ll feel writing it that when I don&#8217;t achieve that headspace then I&#8217;m like &#8220;oops, can&#8217;t write today, oh well&#8221; and blow it off. I&#8217;d like to stop doing that. Just write.</p></p>

  <p><a href="/2013/11/note"><strong>Sunday, November 3 2013</strong></a></p>
  <p><p>Drove over to Cape Lookout on the coast for the morning. Low fog in the valleys and it&#8217;s finally tilted over into <em>cold</em>. Turned the heat on when I realized the cats were cuddling a little more desperately than normal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve focused on work and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BJJ</span></span> this week but I bought the Pololu VNH5019 motor driver shield which can handle over 10 A for a single motor. I figured out the wiring I&#8217;ll need for the Foxcar once that gets here. I&#8217;m probably going to do a custom board with:</p>
<p>- an STM32F4 processor</p>
<p>- XBee wireless (need to explore RF transceivers &#8211; I know nothing about RC hobby RF stuff, except that there&#8217;s a ton of it out there and has been forever.</p>
<p>- camera that&#8217;s fast enough for real-time analysis, so I had to discard a couple I found through Adafruit and Sparkfun.</p>
<p>- 9DOF Sparkfun sensor board</p>
<p>- micro SD card for data logging or image logging</p>
<p>- micro-<span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">JTAG</span></span></p>
<p>Actually, putting a Node 6 from <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PSAS</span></span> on it might be a good idea.</p></p>

  <p><p>Still foggy but the afternoons have been clear blue sky.</p>
<p>I drove in to downtown to hack with greh at Portland State. Started out by putting Raspbian on my Raspberry Pi. I&#8217;ve exhausted Wicker Man references for my servers so on greh&#8217;s advice, I&#8217;m calling it rasputin. At least this way, I should be unable to kill it.</p>
<p>I picked up the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IMEX</span></span> Firefox that showed up in the lab and ripped the guts out, replacing the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IMEX</span></span> control board with an Arduino and Adafruit motor shield. The motor clicks but I swapped servos as well and that works great.</p>
<p>My cat has decided that waking at 3am and show me affection by licking my head until I get out of bed is an A++ way to contribute to a happy and functioning household. I&#8217;m not sure how to convince my cat that it&#8217;s pretty fucking wrong.</p></p>

  <p><p>Not only did I not write for this day, I have only the foggiest memories of what I did.</p>
<p>Went to work, sure. Apparently not much else.</p></p>

  <p><a href="/2013/10/note"><strong>Thursday, October 24 2013</strong></a></p>
  <p><p>Still foggy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still having some forearm pain so I skipped <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BJJ</span></span> and came home to figure out how to break the reading-of-articles that I want to do away from my compulsive browsing-of-Reddit. I have a wifi-only, first-gen iPad for reading and a first-gen (I think) Kindle for reading on backpacking/hiking trips. I added Instapaper to my Firefox on all my computers (work, home desktop, laptop) and dropped all pending bookmarks in there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using Trello for a general tracking-of-everything and I don&#8217;t want this to be a part of that at all. I also can email PDFs to myself to get them into the Kindle App. That should be enough to make this stuff available to me. And I can save links from Ars or Reddit or whatever for later, without wasting cycles worrying that I&#8217;ll never see it again.</p>
<p>Hopefully this&#8217;ll help clear my head. I have a pile of autonomous quadcopter papers I want to read.</p>
<p>I posted the photos from building my 38mm Sentinel rocket from Binder Designs.</p>
<p>I made lemon poppyseed scones that were actually pretty amazing. Also have discovered lemon curd.</p></p>

  <p><p>Americana and crossover choke at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BJJ</span></span>. The forearm pain that took me out on Saturday is still there. Not sure if it&#8217;s tendonitis or what but lizard crawls, the scissor-leg hopping drill just kind of sucked. I ended up mostly watching the technique portion.</p>
<p>Aleve and icing it is.</p></p>

  <p><p>Incredibly foggy this morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://hackaday.com/2009/09/22/introduction-to-ftdi-bitbang-mode/">Found a Hackadday Intro to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FTDI</span></span> tutorial</a> for bitbang mode.</p>

  <p><a href="/2013/10/note"><strong>Saturday, October 19 2013</strong></a></p>
  <p><p>I still liked the website layout this morning. I haven&#8217;t checked it on anything but Firefox&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using the <a
href="http://www.recontech.co.uk/index.php/tutorial/tutorial-1-a-serial-communication-fpga-debug-module/54-de0-nano-serial-communications-tutorial">DE0-Nano Serial Communications Protocol from ReconTech</a> to get the DE0-Nano talking over serial.</p>
<p>Knee bars and ankle locks at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BJJ</span></span> today. My gym is the opposite of macho so there was a lot of emphasis on communication with your partner and training safely without ego. I felt safe even when we were moving quickly.</p>
<p>I feel terrible at writing. My words are all clunky. But I guess getting over that is one point of this daily note thing. The other is to keep a quick written record so I can be accurate when I look back to see how long a project took or so I can easily find a paper I referenced. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p></p>
