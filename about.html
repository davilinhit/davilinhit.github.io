I have five years experience as an aircraft electrical/instrument/flight control systems technician and two years as an aviation quality assurance representative and collateral duty inspector. My own collateral duties were to maintain the technical manuals and hazardous materials. I'm certified as an aviation electrician journeyman by the U.S. Department of Labor.
<br /><br />
I deployed for seven months to Iraq in 2006 and for seven months in 2007-2008 on the <em>USS Tarawa</em> for her last Westpac cruise.

I learned to fly at Somerton Airport and got my license in 2007. I'm currently building cross-country hours so I can begin training for my IFR and Commercial ratings. I've been a member of the 99s (women pilots) since 2007 and the EAA since 2005. I spent a fair amount of my off-duty time in the Marines at the local Somerton Airport helping homebuilders turn wrenches and shoot rivets on their experimental aircraft. 
<br /><br />
My heart's set on building a little snub-nosed <a href="http://sonexaircraft.com">Sonex</a> once I've got a regular income and can trade my one-bedroom apartment for an actual house with a garage to work in. I want to get a taildragger endorsement and learn to fly aerobatics.
<br /><br />
I was a Civil Air Patrol cadet from 2001 to 2004 and earned a Cadet NCO of the Year award. I attended the Washington State encampment, earned my Billy Mitchell Award, was a cadet commander of a glider encampment, was cadet commander of my squadron for several months, represented my squadron at the state (wing) level, and ultimately attended National Blue Beret at Oshkosh in 2003 as a member of Alpha Flight. We parked aircraft and chased down Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELTs) that went off during the event. I credit CAP with getting me completely hooked on airplanes and I recommend it to any kid who's looking to get into the air in their teens.
<br /><br />
My local 99s chapter here in Portland, the Columbia Cascade 99s, is quite active in aerospace education events to expose girls to aviation. I was involved in an all-day class for Girl Scouts and Saturday Academy at Gorge Winds Aviation, Troutdale, in October 2010. This led to me being invited to teach an eight-week aeronautics course for fourth- and fifth-graders at James John Elementary School's LEAP program through Saturday Academy in April and May of 2011. I had an excellent time so teaching and mentoring are definitely things I'd like to do in the future.
<br /><br />
I've made websites for EAA Chapter 590, the Columbia Cascade 99s, and Somerton Airport. I'm very good at explaining how to maintain these sites in a way that gets through to older, less computer-friendly pilots and mechanics who may have completely different ways of mentally handling information from those of us who've grown up on the internet. 
<br /><br />
I'm really interested in the history of aviation, particularly from 1900 to the 1950s. I collected and scanned the images from the Yuma Endurance Days celebration of the then-world record endurance flight by Bob Woodward and Woody Jongeward that put Yuma, Arizona on the aviation map in 1949. The photos can be found <a href="/endurance-days/">here</a>.

I'm a member of the avionics team for the <a href="http://psas.pdx.edu">Portland State Aerospace Society</a> working on an 12' N-motor amateur rocket. I hope to finish a sensor board in time so it can send back live data via wifi during our October 2011 flight. 
<br /><br />
I'm a hardware member of an <a href="http://devel.rov.cs.pdx.edu/projects/iarc">autonomous quadcopter team</a> at Portland State. We're building the quadcopter from scratch. I helped design the power distribution board. We were written up in a <a href="http://roswellflighttestcrew.blogspot.com">local quadcopter blog</a> after OSCON this year. 
<br /><br />
I was the assistant robotics coach for Lincoln High School as they competed in the MATE underwater competition and on-land FIRST Robotics Competition in 2010 and 2011. I attempted to use a video capture card with an underwater camera system we bought from Harbor Freight in hopes of developing an autonomous bot but ran into a variety of technical problems. I did get a good introduction to applying the OpenCV libraries to underwater imagery.
<br /><br />
I'm currently working as the lab manager for the Open Tech Lab at Portland State's Computer Science Department. 
<br /><br />
One of the robots I worked on was Marie Curie for the Portland State Robot Cyber Theater. I swapped microcontrollers and matched servo movements to facial expressions. 
<br /><br />
I served as Vice President of the IEEE-Robotics & Automation Society Student Chapter at Portland State from spring 2010 to spring 2011. My duties included building and collecting content for the website, moving the club to use Redmine for content management, preparing and maintaining the physical lab space, conducting a hexapod workshop for high school students, and holding open labs for RAS members and interested students to work on their projects. I also coordinated with local high school teachers giving advice on how to start their own robotics teams for competitions like MATE and FIRST. 
<br /><br />
The most valuable thing I took away from my experience with RAS was learning to manage a student group: what does and doesn't work to attract and retain students, how to communicate and coordinate within the group, what does and doesn't work in organizing a lab, and the necessity of a cohesive vision so everyone is contributing to the same success.
<br /><br />
I participated in the MCECS Engineering Discovery Showcase at Portland State earlier this spring. I'm in the video giving a tour of the robotics lab from 1:00 to 1:20.
