<h5>College</h5>

<div class="inside-justify">
<strong>M.Eng. Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong> (currently)<br />
2010-2012 (projected), Portland State University
<br /><br />
Undergraduate prep work in computer engineering included digital systems, state machines, calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, solid-state electronic circuit analysis and design, microprocessors, and real-time operating systems. Graduate work has included intelligent robotics, digital image processing, and a survey of analysis and modeling of embedded systems. 
<br /><br />
<strong>B.S. Engineering Technology (Electro-Mechanical Systems)</strong><br />
2009, Old Dominion University
<br /><br />
Sort of a well-rounded technician-level introduction to engineering with courses in statics & dynamics, thermodynamics, electrical circuits, fluid mechanics, programmable logic controllers, and power systems. Included a minor in Engineering Management with courses in engineering economics, project management, statistics, and technical writing.
<br /><br />
<strong>Aviation Maintenance Technology Type 65 Certificate</strong><br />
2007, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
<br /><br />
Included airframe structures, airframe systems, electrical systems, powerplant theory, propulsion systems, and general aeronautics. I hoped to earn my A&P license but my military occupational specialty wasn't compatible; the courses were a good experience anyway as I helped pilots in the local EAA chapter build airplanes on my off-duty time.

<div class="inside-justify">
I earned my private pilot's license in 2006 using money saved from my Iraq deployment and a fantastic scholarship given to me by Peggy Ogram in Yuma, Arizona. I learned to fly with Jim McDermott at Somerton Airport, where Columbia astronaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Clark">Dr. Laurel Clark</a> also learned to fly. I'm currently building cross-country hours so I can begin training for my IFR and Commercial ratings. My heart's set on building a little snub-nosed <a href="http://sonexaircraft.com">Sonex</a> once I've got a regular income and can trade my one-bedroom apartment for an actual house with a garage to work in.
<br /><br />
Member of EAA since 2005; member of chapter 590 in Yuma, Arizona and built their website: <a href="http://eaa590.org">eaa590.org</a> This chapter's really active in building planes and organizing Saturday flyouts for breakfast to neighboring airports and Wednesday night-flights to keep current. The chapter is mostly based at Yuma International and Somerton Airports. I made the Somerton site: <a href="http://www.somertonairport.com/">somertonairport.com</a>
<br /><br />
Member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organization of women pilots. The Imperial So-Lo chapter in El Centro, California, welcomed me with open arms. I'm now in the Columbia Cascade 99s in Portland, and have built their website as well: <a href="http://columbiacascade99s.org">columbiacascade99s.org</a>
<br /><br />
I'm really interested in the history of aviation, particularly 1900 to the 1950s. I collected and  scanned the images from the Yuma Endurance Days celebration of the then-world record endurance flight by Bob Woodward and Woody Jongeward that put Yuma, Arizona on the aviation map.
