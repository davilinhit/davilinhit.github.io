  <div class="title">Foxcar Control Board v1</div>
  <p>December 2013 - Portland, Oregon</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s time to add a control board to my RC car. My goal is a car that does basically everything by itself so I looked into robot exploration algorithms and figured out I need to have localization (where am I?), mapping (what&#8217;s around me?), and planning (where am I going?). I broke up the design of the control board into four parts: power and motors, microcontroller, networking and logging, and all the sensor inputs.</p>
<p>I scrounged up sensors in the Open Tech Lab, where I originally scrounged up the car, and came up with a couple of rangefinders, a PX4FLOW, a 9DOF sensor stick with accel/gyro/mag, and a <span class="caps">CMOS</span> camera which has no markings except for its chip, a VC0706.</p>
<img src="/images/project/foxcar/sensors.png">
<p>I knew I&#8217;d want an output for the servo now but I also wanted to provide the same interface for <span class="caps">ESC</span> <span class="caps">PWM</span> signals as I had on my previous quadcopter control board. Ideally this board could go on a quad without any modifications. As for power, I already knew that the VNH5019 carrier board from Pololu works fine for my car so I designed the board for over 20A of stall current.</p>
<p>I added a micro-<span class="caps">USB</span> connector and hooked the 5V through a diode to the linear regulator so I can&#8217;t power the car from <span class="caps">USB</span> (it&#8217;s not big enough to carry a laptop anyway) but I&#8217;ll be able to debug directly.</p>
<p>I decided I&#8217;d also want logging via a microSD card and networked control over XBees I also have on hand. Overall, the system looks like this.</p>
<img src="/images/project/foxcar/v1-system.png">

<p>I chose the STM32F4 because <span class="caps">PSAS</span> is using it so one of my other boards is using it, I&#8217;ve already got a dev environment for it, I&#8217;d like to use ChibiOS, and it&#8217;s basically capable of anything I would want for its size. It&#8217;s also ubiquitous so there are tons of help forums and it&#8217;s got all the pins, <span class="caps">DAC</span>, and memory I could want.</p>
<p>I got this far and was looking into which <span class="caps">IMU</span> sensors to buy when I talked to a guy who does IMUs who flipped out when I suggested writing a Kalman filter. He stressed that I could do whatever the hell I wanted but he asked if what I really wanted was really to actually spend a year writing a decent <span class="caps">IMU</span>, really? <em>really? think hard now&#8230;</em> and I agreed, okay, no, I want to make my car drive around and get into trouble.</p>
<p>I also realized a basic requirement of this car is to use optical flow instead of <span class="caps">GPS</span> for absolute position correction. This is the root problem I&#8217;m interested in and I&#8217;ve started to read up on possible solutions.</p>
<p>I went looking at the other autopilot boards to find out which sensors they&#8217;re using, then I looked up open source IMUs which already have ports to the STM32F4, and I decided to use FreeIMU with the MPU6000 and HMC5883L. Note that originally I figured I&#8217;d use the MPU6050 and then realized that the 6000 comes with <span class="caps">SPI</span> as well as I2C so the 6000 is the better deal for the faster speed.</p>

<p>I went back to my pile of sensors, took the STM32F4, broke out all the peripherals I could use, and matched up sensors to the chip. I hooked up the compass and Invensense gyro/accelometer chip, then broke all the other <span class="caps">GPIO</span> points left over into as many header as I could. Finally, I worked up a schematic using my proven previous design for the XBee, <span class="caps">USB</span>, and SD card.</p>

<p>I started the schematic on November 22nd and finished on December 15th, which was exactly on target. I worked in two crunch weeks, the first for the schematic and the second for layout, with a break between them to let the schematic linger a little.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/wicker/Self-Driving-RC-Car/">final schematics and boards are up on Github</a>.</p>
<p>The final 4-layer board comes out to 3.5&#215;2.2 inches for an OSHPark cost of $77 for three.</p>
