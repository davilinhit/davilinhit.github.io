          <p><strong>Landslide Frequency and Bedrock Types</strong><br />
  August 2011 - Portland State University</p>

  <p>This was a project for my computer-based physical geology lab at Portland State. The idea was to use ArcMap to identify and describe controlling factors, specifically bedrock type and soil type, which contributed to the landslides that occurred in and around the Portland area during 1996-1997.</p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/project/geolab/landslides-1.png"></div>
<p>The first possible contributing factor to the landslides in this report is bedrock type. Figure 2 shows landslide distribution in the study area against the bedrock types. Table 1 presents the relative number. The two most common geologic types on which landslides occurred were Tc and Qs.</p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/project/geolab/landslides-2.png"></div>
<p>The following bedrock type descriptions were taken from the <a href="http://nwdata.geol.pdx.edu/OR-Geology/explanation.php">Portland State University Geology Department</a>. [the system has since broken; some information was lost. QTba is from Wikipedia.]</p>
<p><em>Tc Columbia River Basalt Group and related flows from the Miocene. Subaerial basalt and minor andesite lava flows and flow breccia; locally may include invasive basalt flows. Flows locally grade laterally into subaqueous pillow-palagonite complexes and bedded palagonitic tuff and breccia. In places includes tuffaceous sedimentary interbeds. Joints commonly coated with nontronite and other clayey alteration products. Locally deeply weathered to lateritic soil. Occurs principally in the Willamette Valley from Salem north to the Columbia River and eastward into the Cascade Range. Unit includes correlative Stayton Lavas of Thayer (1936, 1939). See also description of unit for eastern Oregon. Swanson and others (1979) and Swanson and others (1981) locally separated rocks into: Wanapum Basalt (Tcw) and Grande Ronde Basalt (Tcg).</em></p>
<p><em>QTba describes quaternary basaltic andesite is a black volcanic rock containing about 55% silica. Minerals in basaltic andesite include olivine, augite and plagioclase.</em></p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/project/geolab/landslides-3.png"></div>
<p>The second contributing factor to the landslides was soil type. Figure 3 and Table 2 show the frequency of landslides and the soil types where they occurred. The most landslides occurred in soil types 17E and 56E, which are both loams. The following descriptions are from Survey of Multnomah County, Oregon.</p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/project/geolab/landslides-4.png"></div>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/project/geolab/landslides-5.png"></div>
<p><em>17E Goble silt loam &#8230; This steep, moderately drained soil is on convex side slopes of ridgetops. This soil formed in silty materials mixed with volcanic ash &#8230; Increased population growth has resulted in increased home construction on this soil. This soil has severe limitations for dwellings and roads because of steep slopes. Other limitations are the seasonal high water table, low bearing strength, and the slowly permeable fragipan at a depth of 30 to 45 inches. Excavating during summer is difficult because of the strongly compacted fragipan. Slumping is possible in areas of cut and fill, and additional maintenance of banks, roads, and building foundations is required. A seasonal water table is perched on top of the fragipan, and drainage is required for best results with basements.</p>
<p>56E Wauld gravelly loam &#8230; typically, the surface layer is very dark brown very gravelly loam about 6 inches thick. The subsoil is very dark grayish brown and dark brown very gravelly clay loam about 24 inches thick. Depth to basalt is 30 inches. &#8230; This soil has severe limitations for homesites and other uses. The major limitations for urban development are depth to bedrock, high concentration of coarse fragments, and slopes of 30 to 70 percent.</em></p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;"> <img src="/images/project/geolab/landslides-6.png"></div>
<p>The final contributing factor to consider is the steepness of the slopes where landslides occurred. The loam deposits 17E and 56E were described as occurring on slopes of 30 to 70 percent, which is also where the landslides occur on Figure 4. The landslides occur on the slopes of greater than 15 percent.</p>
