Hi! I'm Jen Hanni. I an embedded systems geek from Portland, Oregon, where by day I'm a systems engineering intern at a local aerospace company while attending graduate school in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Portland State University. I want to work with design and control of remotely operated and unmanned aerial vehicles in space exploration. I've mentored FIRST Robotics, taught aeronautics to elementary school kids, and served five years in the U.S. Marines as an avionics technician on Harrier jump jets. I travel, hike, take pictures, read, and build stuff.
