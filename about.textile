Hi. I'm Jen Hanni. I'm a 26 year hardware hacker and aspiring embedded systems programmer from Portland, Oregon. I'm a systems engineering intern at a local aerospace company while attending graduate school in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Portland State University. I want to work with design and control of remotely operated and unmanned aerial vehicles in space exploration. I've mentored FIRST Robotics, taught aeronautics to elementary school kids, and served five years in the U.S. Marines as an avionics technician on Harrier jump jets. I travel, hike, take pictures, read, and can be found both on Starcraft 2 and Reddit.
