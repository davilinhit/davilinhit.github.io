title: Hi!
---

I'm an electrical engineer helping provide small-batch printed circuit boards at <a href="http://oshpark.com">OSH Park</a>, and I develop hardware prototypes through <a href="http://wickerbox.net">Wickerbox Electronics</a>. You can find my open source code and schematics on <a href="http://github.com/wicker/">Github</a>.

I used to work on aircraft cameras at <a href="http://max-viz.com">Astronics Max-Viz</a>, and I'm a private pilot, ham radio operator, and the owner of an underwater robot. I explore different ways of moving through and interacting with the world.  

The best way to contact me is at <a href="mailto:jeh.wicker@gmail.com">jeh.wicker@gmail.com</a>.
