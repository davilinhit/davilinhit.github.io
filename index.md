#### About Jenner

My goal is to build networked sensor hardware to collect data about the natural environment, and then visualize that data on the web or (eventually) in an immersive way through virtual or augmented reality so that people can better understand the effect of human development on the natural world. 

Besides being a freelance hardware developer, I'm an outdoorsy Oregonian and I've been reading about deep ecology lately. 

I'm not on social media, but you can email me at jeh.wicker@gmail.com.
