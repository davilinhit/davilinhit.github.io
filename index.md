#### Hi!

I'm a freelance hardware developer and outdoorsy Oregonian. 

I work to build networked sensor hardware to collect data about the environment, and then visualize that data on the web so that people can better understand how they're a part of the natural world.

I'm interested in taking lessons from ecology, philosophy, and natural history to figure out how to live more responsibly as we face the major social, political, and economic shifts coming from climate change.

I'm not on social media, but you can email me at jenner@wickerbox.net.
