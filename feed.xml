				<title>Snow at the Tualatin Refuge</title>

&lt;p&gt;Just the other night, the wetland was covered in geese; now it&amp;#8217;s ice and slush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ruOVnpaOcRY/Uv7TwnSlMkI/AAAAAAAAGN8/fU_ElHesVRI/w604-h403-no/DSCF2257.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human-sized &amp;#8220;eagle&amp;#8221; nest they built back in summer is holding up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on through the Rock Creek study area and along the edge of the open wetland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of little birds foraging, geese passing overhead, and a hawk keeping an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the creek around to the wetland. I spent a lot of time playing with lighting. Still not sure I have it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>124km DxWifi Flight Test</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The antenna setup in the back of the plane. We were all about all these different ways to attach the antenna, internally and externally, but it turned out taping it in the back window was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ysw4i0ULtE/UvfKknq5SNI/AAAAAAAAGDU/EZlqiiVixgk/w960-h720-no/IMG_0695.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxiing out and taking off at Troutdale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TvOelSrx3Bg/UvfKkrLZsSI/AAAAAAAAGDQ/otPMXWC3tvA/w960-h720-no/IMG_0700.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EhEK-vaTiTw/UvfKkt983qI/AAAAAAAAGDM/D4uOwlBy11E/w960-h720-no/IMG_0701.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking northeast towards Camas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9K4RJKWAsMA/UvfKlIslUPI/AAAAAAAAGDk/Kq0KJXY4hco/w960-h720-no/IMG_0713.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our most excellent pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XXMKWeMlvz8/UvfKl35USSI/AAAAAAAAGDo/PDwkTMZM_a4/w584-h779-no/IMG_0720.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our most excellent antenna operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H8gL8t45hAI/UvfKn5PxdcI/AAAAAAAAGEY/w2X-53i6GXQ/w584-h779-no/IMG_0811.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a few circles on the Washington side of the river to give the Rocky Butte ground team a chance to get up and running ot see if they could catch our packets. We had no idea if we were going to even be able to make contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TWw3iw3wTw0/UvfKl4TmjII/AAAAAAAAGDs/ZXNSpQmkGIw/w960-h720-no/IMG_0740.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we did! And we headed north to the west of Mt St Helens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IgMO3tpdHF8/UvfKmQ4acTI/AAAAAAAAGD8/xp6eJzMWNLI/w960-h720-no/IMG_0752.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wCzieLTOorE/UvfKm1UKqZI/AAAAAAAAGEA/BfhKxDCIZ7A/w960-h720-no/IMG_0766.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We warned the ground team we might lose them for a minute or two and we took a detour to check out the caldera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qCLxoDYDQ7g/UvfKnTtyZKI/AAAAAAAAGEQ/0kqWHl11R_Q/w960-h720-no/IMG_0795.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up spending a lot of time circling over Morton, WA, but that was about where our signal problems started. We did continue on to Kapowsin Field, right at the edge of Seattle airspace, at about 10,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y7iYSimB4NY/UvfKnz2HcKI/AAAAAAAAGEo/H6QS5U1nFdc/w584-h779-no/IMG_0815.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back south, we moved the antenna to the front right window but we couldn&amp;#8217;t shake the communication problems. We lost both &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and radio to Rocky Butte so when we turned around the ground team wasn&amp;#8217;t entirely sure where we were and we weren&amp;#8217;t ever really able to re-establish contact. The antennas have a very narrow beam over which they can receive so if we had to be exactly where the Rocky Butte team was pointing their antenna, and for the most part we weren&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JqMbAWpz4ck/UvfKocwxLSI/AAAAAAAAGE8/5Er-tvBSiic/w960-h720-no/IMG_0818.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oyad-ftFdIY/UvfKpI0gsqI/AAAAAAAAGE0/nJYt0cSIObk/w960-h720-no/IMG_0819.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also considering fuel/range issues and ended up deciding to just head back to Troutdale and call it a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9EGjJdCLPx4/UvfKpJkaTNI/AAAAAAAAGE4/n_1UcIJfmb0/w584-h779-no/IMG_0823.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-U-CKkvMcVsY/UvfKpe4KU7I/AAAAAAAAGFc/QwvtFun61BQ/w960-h720-no/IMG_0825.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On final to Troutdale, with bonus propellers. (It&amp;#8217;s actually not really possible with iPhone to take a picture out the front window that doesn&amp;#8217;t catch the prop.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6gzbq8Unn0k/UvfKp3YuweI/AAAAAAAAGFQ/i3HFJIdGmZA/w584-h779-no/IMG_0855.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pilot puts the plane away.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Oven Control Board v2</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I worked with Tung as part of the ME capstone team at Portland State to update the oven controller Arduino shield I made last week. Tung had already updated the Eagle schematic so this time for me it was just layout, routing, and basic soldering. I fixed the one via problem but then promptly made the same mistake on the other set of headers, so I delivered the board last night and it should work fine but the soldering was trickier than I&amp;#8217;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still so spoiled by having OSHPark. The only Gerbers I give our lab&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LPKF&lt;/span&gt; router are the Top Layer, Bottom Layer, Board Outline, and Unplated Drill. No silkscreen. I could solder mask but I haven&amp;#8217;t. Maybe next time. I used materials and headers I had on hand but even through OSHPark it&amp;#8217;d be just under $30 for three boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the schematic, layout, and final photos. Eagle files are on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wicker/oven-controller/&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was a little bummed this morning that January&amp;#8217;s over and I don&amp;#8217;t have any other hardware stuff to post about but I realized that I&amp;#8217;ve been super busy doing, you know, work for which I&amp;#8217;m paid and can&amp;#8217;t talk about. On the hobby hacking side, I&amp;#8217;ve done plenty of work this month between the oven controller, a couple of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; RF board design reviews, the DxWiFi test, and my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BJJ&lt;/span&gt; habit. I&amp;#8217;ve also had four sessions of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EPL&lt;/span&gt; managing where other people came in to work on stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest reasons for having the site is to remind myself that I do things by posting pictures of the stuff I do. I tend to forget and then blame myself for being Not Productive Enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So looking back, I&amp;#8217;m delighted to remember that I had a really enjoyable January.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;My library flow for Eagle is to work out of a single directory called ~/.eagle and have all my libraries, scripts, etc. to be in there. Anything that would be used by multiple designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never, ever, ever use the epf files and I&amp;#8217;ve yet to meet anybody who does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start a new design, I make a repo on Github and clone it to my dev machine. I create a schematic and start working. At some point I&amp;#8217;ll make the board and work on that. Any changes to libraries happens in that default directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m reading to commit, I use the Eagle export function to create multiple library files into a local folder called &amp;#8216;lbr&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;libraries&amp;#8217; so anybody who forks the repo has all the parts they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I git pull, I always check if I got updated libraries and I&amp;#8217;ll wrap them back into my default library. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure I&amp;#8217;m running the risk of losing work in the overwriting/copying process but I&amp;#8217;m kind of stuck on what to do about it, except be very careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagle&amp;#8217;s libraries are basically just frustrating as hell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Oven Control Board v1</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;An ME capstone team at Portland State is working on an oven so we can cure our own composites. It&amp;#8217;s awesome. This oven control board was a five-day project that came out of nowhere this week on Tuesday and which I delivered on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tung, their electrical person, already had the design figured out and working with breadboard components and an Arduino. What he really wanted was an Arduino shield so we met, looked at what he had, and figured out how we&amp;#8217;d put it on the right footprint. This is the first time I&amp;#8217;d been able to sit with someone who was new to Eagle and really explain what makes a decent schematic, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty cool to see how much I&amp;#8217;ve learned in just a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/oven-control-board/ovenboard-schema.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout was constrained by the shield but even moreso by our plan to use the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LPKF&lt;/span&gt; router. It had to be a two-layer board that didn&amp;#8217;t have plated through-holes or vias. I managed to put all the traces except one on the bottom layer because all the components get soldered on the bottom side (they&amp;#8217;re all through-hole) and then I just made that a much wider polygon fill and dropped vias to get the top-trace signal connected down below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Arduino shields sit on top of the Arduino so I had to drop an extra via on each pad of the 0.1&amp;quot; headers so copper wire could be slid through and squashed, essentially plating them myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/oven-control-board/ovenboard-layout.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final product doesn&amp;#8217;t look too shabby. Well, I take that back &amp;#8212; the isolation on the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LPKF&lt;/span&gt; is so tiny (even at the double-width!) that I&amp;#8217;m terrified of putting too much solder on each pin and shorting it outside the pad. This is really crappy soldering but I ohmed everything out so electrically the joints are fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely I&amp;#8217;ve been spoiled with OSHPark and $5/sq in board with plated through-holes and solder mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The libraries and everything are all up in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wicker/oven-controller&quot;&gt;oven-controller Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;I got super busy with work but then this week have done a ton of rocket club stuff. The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; RF board is still in design reviews but I think we&amp;#8217;ve got the RF side figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished an oven control board &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt; layout and got it routed for the oven team. All the files are in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wicker/oven-controller/&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went up to Rocky Butte and shot wifi packets to Council Crest with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/psas/DxWiFi/&quot;&gt;DxWiFi team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think running around at full speed finally let the cold I&amp;#8217;ve been fighting hit me because I was already feeling like crap on Sunday and then I ended up sleeping til the afternoon today. Ugh. Tomorrow will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got the email that says my Foxcar control board is in the mail so I guess I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing this weekend&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Beautiful day doing flight test of our cameras for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been looking at putting the Robot Operating System on the STM32F Discovery Board so I took a brief detour through basic toolchain review. A couple nice links are these at &lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/Toolchains&quot;&gt;eLinux &amp;#8211; Toolchains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kunen.org/uC/gnu_tool.html&quot;&gt;thing2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, paraphrasing from the article, I need disk space, decent &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; and memory, recent gcc compiler and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; build utilities for the sort of stuff I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m prototyping on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; processors so I build arm-none-eabi and newlib, which successfully can build the libraries; works with FreeRTOS, ChibiOS, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ROS&lt;/span&gt;; and can make binaries for bare metal (no OS) software. I&amp;#8217;m not developing for embedded Linux targets so I don&amp;#8217;t have to build against glibc. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what an embedded Linux target really is, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an arm-x-eabi means it&amp;#8217;s for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; with the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; standard &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EABI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;arm-none-eabi means it&amp;#8217;s not for a specific OS or build&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;arm-psas-eabi means it expects the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PSAS&lt;/span&gt; environment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;arm-linux-eabi is designed to be used to build programs with glibc under Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
