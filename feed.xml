				<title>Oven Control Board v1</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;An ME capstone team at Portland State is working on an oven so we can cure our own composites. It&amp;#8217;s awesome. This oven control board was a five-day project that came out of nowhere this week on Tuesday and which I delivered on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tung, their electrical person, already had the design figured out and working with breadboard components and an Arduino. What he really wanted was an Arduino shield so we met, looked at what he had, and figured out how we&amp;#8217;d put it on the right footprint. This is the first time I&amp;#8217;d been able to sit with someone who was new to Eagle and really explain what makes a decent schematic, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty cool to see how much I&amp;#8217;ve learned in just a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/oven-control-board/ovenboard-schema.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout was constrained by the shield but even moreso by our plan to use the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LPKF&lt;/span&gt; router. It had to be a two-layer board that didn&amp;#8217;t have plated through-holes or vias. I managed to put all the traces except one on the bottom layer because all the components get soldered on the bottom side (they&amp;#8217;re all through-hole) and then I just made that a much wider polygon fill and dropped vias to get the top-trace signal connected down below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Arduino shields sit on top of the Arduino so I had to drop an extra via on each pad of the 0.1&amp;quot; headers so copper wire could be slid through and squashed, essentially plating them myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/oven-control-board/ovenboard-layout.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final product doesn&amp;#8217;t look too shabby. Well, I take that back &amp;#8212; the isolation on the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LPKF&lt;/span&gt; is so tiny (even at the double-width!) that I&amp;#8217;m terrified of putting too much solder on each pin and shorting it outside the pad. This is really crappy soldering but I ohmed everything out so electrically the joints are fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely I&amp;#8217;ve been spoiled with OSHPark and $5/sq in board with plated through-holes and solder mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The libraries and everything are all up in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wicker/oven-controller&quot;&gt;oven-controller Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;I got super busy with work but then this week have done a ton of rocket club stuff. The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; RF board is still in design reviews but I think we&amp;#8217;ve got the RF side figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished an oven control board &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PCB&lt;/span&gt; layout and got it routed for the oven team. All the files are in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wicker/oven-controller/&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went up to Rocky Butte and shot wifi packets to Council Crest with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/psas/DxWiFi/&quot;&gt;DxWiFi team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think running around at full speed finally let the cold I&amp;#8217;ve been fighting hit me because I was already feeling like crap on Sunday and then I ended up sleeping til the afternoon today. Ugh. Tomorrow will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got the email that says my Foxcar control board is in the mail so I guess I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing this weekend&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Beautiful day doing flight test of our cameras for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been looking at putting the Robot Operating System on the STM32F Discovery Board so I took a brief detour through basic toolchain review. A couple nice links are these at &lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/Toolchains&quot;&gt;eLinux &amp;#8211; Toolchains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kunen.org/uC/gnu_tool.html&quot;&gt;thing2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, paraphrasing from the article, I need disk space, decent &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; and memory, recent gcc compiler and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; build utilities for the sort of stuff I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m prototyping on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; processors so I build arm-none-eabi and newlib, which successfully can build the libraries; works with FreeRTOS, ChibiOS, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ROS&lt;/span&gt;; and can make binaries for bare metal (no OS) software. I&amp;#8217;m not developing for embedded Linux targets so I don&amp;#8217;t have to build against glibc. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what an embedded Linux target really is, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an arm-x-eabi means it&amp;#8217;s for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; with the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; standard &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EABI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;arm-none-eabi means it&amp;#8217;s not for a specific OS or build&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;arm-psas-eabi means it expects the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PSAS&lt;/span&gt; environment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;arm-linux-eabi is designed to be used to build programs with glibc under Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a nice, long note last night but with today&amp;#8217;s date about my process for designing PCBs and then blew it away this morning by running the makenote script for today. Argh. Well, it had occurred to me that I should add a line to the makenote script to prompt me about the overwrite if a post already exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that&amp;#8217;s as easy as adding -i to the cp command and, as a bonus, if I tell it &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; (I don&amp;#8217;t want it to overwrite) then the script executes the next line which is opening the file so I can edit. I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple random notes about sed to add at the beginning and end of a line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s/$/text/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;s/^/text/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davehylands.com/Wood-Working/Electronics-Workbench/&quot;&gt;Dave Hyland&amp;#8217;s Electronics Workbench&lt;/a&gt; via StackExchange because I&amp;#8217;ve been inventorying my piles of components. I kind of want to do this as a SolidWorks project. I do have a closet in my office&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ve been making a database on summerisle with an inventory of all the parts I have at home. I&amp;#8217;m tired of trying to match them up. I&amp;#8217;m going to get a trial of Illustrator and mock up an interface or something to drop on top of it, mostly because the Adobe stuff is so shiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#8217;ve been going through a ton of old photos and organizing all my photo albums on one hard drive. It&amp;#8217;s pretty cool to look at photos I took in 2000 as a fifteen-year old. They&amp;#8217;re mostly crap, but their value to me is mostly in memories so that&amp;#8217;s all right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title photo from today is the first photo I took on the X100S back in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did add several outdoor posts from last year, including &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/08/tualatin-wildlife-refuge-evening/&quot;&gt;Tualatin Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/09/dismal-nitch&quot;&gt;Dismal Nitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/badger-creek&quot;&gt;Badger Creek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/callahans-to-green-springs-inn&quot;&gt;Callahan&amp;#8217;s to Green Springs Inn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I got the photos from Kalaloch up, which I had to take with my iPhone because I left my camera battery (!!!!!) in Portland. But it was gorgeous up there anyway, I just think the X100S would have given me more control over the light. The beach, ocean, and sky all turn the same sort of gray when it&amp;#8217;s overcast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Caution: contents contain notes about the Eagle &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; program. Readers allergic to Eagle should skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the standard version of Eagle for making printed circuit boards. It&amp;#8217;s basically a cad program you can use to draw the schematic and then route the layout of the final board. I usually take my files and send them off to OSHPark to be made into real physical boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t recommend Eagle anymore; I&amp;#8217;ve heard too many good things about KiCad, which is open source and free. Go learn that instead if you haven&amp;#8217;t already put time and money into Eagle. I&amp;#8217;ve had customer support problems and nobody ever actually gave me a copy of the Eagle license that they made me pay money for. They also misrepresented what an academic license consisted of. So go to KiCad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This note&amp;#8217;s about the eagle.scr startup script which sets default values for things like via diameter, wire size, and grid size. I look to OSHPark&amp;#8217;s design rules to find out what these values ought to be. The fab houses that receive my design files and fabricate my boards for me set the minimum widths, distances, diameters, etc that their machinery can accommodate considering how much money I want to give them. I like to set my minimum settings a little larger so I don&amp;#8217;t run the risk of small inaccuracies breaking my design but I can go smaller if I need to. (I don&amp;#8217;t usually need to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting a little with the Eagle startup script. I was using semi-colons inconsistently and it turns out if you have multiple statements on one line, you need to separate them with a semi-colon. Either a semi-colon or a newline appear to work for statements in list form. For example, this works fine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;change drill 0.013; change diameter 0.027&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change shape round;  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#8217;t:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;change drill 0.013 change diameter 0.027&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;change drill 0.013&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change diameter 0.027&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script allows you to set default values for the board, schematic, device, symbol, package, and general library editing screens. The package screen is basically the same as board except there&amp;#8217;s no need to specify the route width because there isn&amp;#8217;t any routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in inches because that&amp;#8217;s how I started out and the important thing is just to be consistent with grid sizes and measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My script looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OVERALL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GRID IN 0.0125 DOTS ON ALT IN 0.025;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BOARD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change drill 0.013      # drill/hold diameter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change diameter 0.027   # via pad diameter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change shape round      # via shape&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change width 0.01       # route width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change size 0.50        # text size&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SCH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change width 0.006      # wire width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change size 0.50        # text size&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No changes needed for library or device&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change length middle    # default pin length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change visible both     # pin and pad number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change shape round      # via shape&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change diameter 0.027   # via pad diameter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change drill 0.013      # drill/hold diameter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;change size 0.050&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;I drove up to Beach 4 and walked up to the tide pools.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;This makenote script is nifty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the RF board layout this afternoon but need to review it tomorrow, particularly in the RF side around LNA2 and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ANTBIAS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed in Ocean City last night and came home today through Astoria and Forest Grove and the valley, sneaking into Newberg the back way. Much better than I-5 and not all that much longer a drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a This American Life story where one of the editors has her mom on the show to talk about her seven (or however many) things nobody wants to hear about in conversation when you show up for a dinner party. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure the weather and the route are two of the however many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a nice sunset, anyway. And it&amp;#8217;s nice to be home. I&amp;#8217;m always kind of overwhelmed by how beautiful the forests and coast can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stacked the motor driver board and the XBee-bearing protoshield on top of my Arduino and was able to control the steering of the Foxcar by way of characters typed in minicom on my laptop through another XBee. I also investigated robot libraries and realized I should really be using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ROS&lt;/span&gt;, not ChibiOS, which is the Robot Operating System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an STM32F Discovery board so I&amp;#8217;m going to put &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ROS&lt;/span&gt; on that next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Spent a couple days in a cabin at Kalaloch Lodge on the Olympic Peninsula. I edited some posts and got everything ready for when I get home to just push the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple interesting projects in the pipeline, including the RF board and an implementation of Timo Bergmann&amp;#8217;s Sound of Sorting. I never had the algorithms class at school so writing fifteen sorts with the help of the Intro to Algorithms, 3rd Ed, has introduced me to a bunch of concepts &amp;#8211; optimization among them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>25 Dec 2013</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This note is trying out my new script. It first gets the current date in the right format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NAME=$(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it copies a template I made in _layouts/ and names it using that date output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp $SRCDIR/_layouts/note_  .textile $SRCDIR/_posts/$NAME-note.textile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it opens it for editing so I can do my thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim $SRCDIR/_posts/$NAME-note.textile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is. Yay for lowering transaction costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also figured out a way to add image to posts but they only show up on the notebook page, not the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed, because they&amp;#8217;re slid in from the yaml header and sit above the title. They look nice so I&amp;#8217;m calling it good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Foxcar Control Board v1</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time to add a control board to my RC car. My goal is a car that does basically everything by itself so I looked into robot exploration algorithms and figured out I need to have localization (where am I?), mapping (what&amp;#8217;s around me?), and planning (where am I going?). I broke up the design of the control board into four parts: power and motors, microcontroller, networking and logging, and all the sensor inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scrounged up sensors in the Open Tech Lab, where I originally scrounged up the car, and came up with a couple of rangefinders, a PX4FLOW, a 9DOF sensor stick with accel/gyro/mag, and a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMOS&lt;/span&gt; camera which has no markings except for its chip, a VC0706.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/foxcar/sensors.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I&amp;#8217;d want an output for the servo now but I also wanted to provide the same interface for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ESC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PWM&lt;/span&gt; signals as I had on my previous quadcopter control board. Ideally this board could go on a quad without any modifications. As for power, I already knew that the VNH5019 carrier board from Pololu works fine for my car so I designed the board for over 20A of stall current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a micro-&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; connector and hooked the 5V through a diode to the linear regulator so I can&amp;#8217;t power the car from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; (it&amp;#8217;s not big enough to carry a laptop anyway) but I&amp;#8217;ll be able to debug directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I&amp;#8217;d also want logging via a microSD card and networked control over XBees I also have on hand. Overall, the system looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/foxcar/v1-system.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose the STM32F4 because &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PSAS&lt;/span&gt; is using it so one of my other boards is using it, I&amp;#8217;ve already got a dev environment for it, I&amp;#8217;d like to use ChibiOS, and it&amp;#8217;s basically capable of anything I would want for its size. It&amp;#8217;s also ubiquitous so there are tons of help forums and it&amp;#8217;s got all the pins, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DAC&lt;/span&gt;, and memory I could want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this far and was looking into which &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMU&lt;/span&gt; sensors to buy when I talked to a guy who does IMUs who flipped out when I suggested writing a Kalman filter. He stressed that I could do whatever the hell I wanted but he asked if what I really wanted was really to actually spend a year writing a decent &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMU&lt;/span&gt;, really? &lt;em&gt;really? think hard now&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt; and I agreed, okay, no, I want to make my car drive around and get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized a basic requirement of this car is to use optical flow instead of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; for absolute position correction. This is the root problem I&amp;#8217;m interested in and I&amp;#8217;ve started to read up on possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went looking at the other autopilot boards to find out which sensors they&amp;#8217;re using, then I looked up open source IMUs which already have ports to the STM32F4, and I decided to use FreeIMU with the MPU6000 and HMC5883L. Note that originally I figured I&amp;#8217;d use the MPU6050 and then realized that the 6000 comes with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SPI&lt;/span&gt; as well as I2C so the 6000 is the better deal for the faster speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/foxcar/autopilots.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to my pile of sensors, took the STM32F4, broke out all the peripherals I could use, and matched up sensors to the chip. I hooked up the compass and Invensense gyro/accelometer chip, then broke all the other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPIO&lt;/span&gt; points left over into as many header as I could. Finally, I worked up a schematic using my proven previous design for the XBee, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;, and SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/foxcar/foxcar-control-board-v1-sch-sheet1.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/foxcar/foxcar-control-board-v1-sch-sheet2.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the schematic on November 22nd and finished on December 15th, which was exactly on target. I worked in two crunch weeks, the first for the schematic and the second for layout, with a break between them to let the schematic linger a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/project/foxcar/foxcar-control-board-v1-brd.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wicker/Self-Driving-RC-Car/&quot;&gt;final schematics and boards are up on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final 4-layer board comes out to 3.5&amp;#215;2.2 inches for an OSHPark cost of $77 for three.&lt;/p&gt;
