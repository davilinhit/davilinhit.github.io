    <p>The Marine Advanced Technology Education (<span class="caps">MATE</span>) Center in Monterey Bay coordinates an annual international robotics competition open to student teams of all academic levels from elementary schools to university. <span class="caps">MATE</span> designs a new underwater obstacle course consisting of mission tasks to be navigated and completed by a tethered underwater vehicle remotely-operated from a driver station on the surface. Missions are chosen to imitate real-world events in ROVs and judges are solicited from oceanography and commercial <span class="caps">ROV</span> companies.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="/images/project/underwater/figure5.gif"></div>
<p>K-12 teams (Scout and Ranger class) are required to compete at regional competitions. The winner from each attends the international competition. University teams are only required to attend regionals to demonstrate safety awareness and the ability to maneuver in the water. There are twenty regional competitions in the world; the five non-U.S. locations are in Scotland, Hong Kong, Japan, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The Lincoln High School robotics team has competed in this competition since 2008, when they won the Pacific Northwest regional and took fourth place in the international competition at University of California San Diego.</p>
<p>I joined the team as the assistant coach in 2010 and attended the Northwest regional in 2010 and 2011. The team is very self-directed so coaches and mentors were mostly there to give advice. The team I ended up supporting the most with project management, organization, programming, and electronics was the junior Sea Dawgs team with their bot, the <em>Sea Pup</em>.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="/images/project/mate-bots/sea-pup.png"></div>
<p>The students received the mission in December and designed the entire underwater vehicle by May when they went to Federal Way. The design decisions usually came down to simplicity and cost. The frame was <span class="caps">PVC</span> with a mesh-floored center to scoop up the gummy &#8216;crustaceans&#8217;. The bot was made neutrally buoyant by attaching styrofoam and empty water bottles. The vertical maneuvering was pneumatic tubing fed down the tether into duct-taped ziploc bags attached to the frame. It was discovered that expensive Nalgene bottles were far superior to regular water bottles, which crushed under the pressure of fifteen feet of water, but filling the ziploc bags with air was a surprisingly effective solution.</p>
<p>All the electronics were kept on the surface and the underwater cameras we used were manufactured for the purpose so we avoided issues of waterproofing. The lengths to which the team went to avoid programming was impressive. They solved the lateral maneuvering problem with a brilliantly simple solution: two rocker switches that corresponded to one modified bilge pump on each corner of the frame. Rocking both switches forward activated the two rear-facing pumps and pushed the bot forward; rocking them both back activated the two in front and pushed the bot to the rear.</p>
<p>Alternating the forward-left and rear-right made the bot turn to the left and vice-versa for turning the bot to the right. The system had the advantage of being intuitive for the pilot.</p>
<p>Because of this aversity to coding and limited experience with <span class="caps">CAD</span>, most of the missions were impossible for the bot to accomplish. There was no plan for recovering agar and various analog sensors were attached in view of the underwater cameras which meant there were visibility problems in the pool. They did have a hydrophone for finding a &#8220;rumbling sea vent&#8221; and they were able to make a temperature graph by hovering by different vents and checking a meat thermometer, but this is a still captured from one of the cameras showing their gummy crustacean catch that shows what kind of view they were up against.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="/images/project/mate-bots/visibility.png"></div>
<p>The bot below is the senior team&#8217;s bot. That team had three years experience over the novice team and the difference was clear in all aspects of their design and build process. They were assuming less in the earlier stages and building faster, to have more time testing.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="/images/project/mate-bots/senior-bot.png"></div>
<p>The experience of designing, building, and testing their design in seven months was immensely rewarding and most of the team came away wanting to major in engineering in college. Whatever their major, they took many, many 1essons for all sorts of future projects so I was very impressed and do plan to continue mentoring if the opportunity arises.</p>
