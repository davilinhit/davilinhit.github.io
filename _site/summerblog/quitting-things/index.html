    <p>So I&#8217;m having a summer of awesome. Everything&#8217;s going really well. I&#8217;ve got projects, school, a new part-time lab manager position, and some flying in my life. Things are really good.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re good, in part, because I&#8217;m slowly dropping a whole pile of things that have been taking up my time, particularly internet drama things. So in no particular order, the stuff I&#8217;ve left behind:</p>
<p>1. I was in a writing club and then I realized that nobody really read my stuff. Also, I was seeking out the gossip and the drama, which is really I made a list of all the reasons I still wanted to be in the club and couldn&#8217;t really find any. I had a couple of friends who fervently told me they wanted me to stay in the club, they&#8217;d always want to talk to me, etc. but now, a few weeks later, they haven&#8217;t contacted me at all. I see them on gmail a lot but they never talk. I realize now that I barely knew them and that it was really a club-only friendship.</p>
<p>2. I stopped my internet service at home. I&#8217;ve got an iPad for the few nights I want to watch something on Netflix (usually off-beat documentaries) and knowing I had it available was really what made me able to cut myself off of the Clear wifi. I&#8217;m glad I did. At first, I watched Netflix all the time in the evening &#8230; and then a friend got me hooked on Game of Thrones and I had to spend my evenings reading for a couple weeks, and now I skim skeptically through the Netflix offerings and put the iPad away.</p>
<p>With internet went most of my TV and media. Most of it makes me angry. Most of it&#8217;s factually wrong. The worst part is when I&#8217;d find myself getting angry or otherwise righteously indignant about something that&#8217;s not even true. I don&#8217;t like most fictional shows. I don&#8217;t like the writing and I&#8217;m not sucked in by the characters. The shows I followed have all jumped the shark in the last year (possibly <em>I</em> jumped the shark) and I just haven&#8217;t bothered to replace them.</p>
<p>I used to click through Google News a billion times a day. The computer science crowd was starting to suck me into Reddit and cute cat pictures but really, I&#8217;m better off without them. I read <span class="caps">MAKE</span> and a couple airplane magazines but mostly I&#8217;m filtering science stuff into Google Reader. If I&#8217;m struck by a need to find out what Company X is doing, I&#8217;ll go read up on Company X at that moment. The world doesn&#8217;t end if I don&#8217;t know about the BiPod until somebody mentions it &#8230; which they will, because I&#8217;m surrounded by the kind of people I want to be surrounded by. Of <em>course</em> they&#8217;re going to tell me all about it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have Twitter and my Facebook&#8217;s just kind of a placeholder. I don&#8217;t check it. You can reach me by text, email, <span class="caps">IRC</span>, or (I&#8217;ll call you back, maybe) phone&#8230; but then I did get invited to Google Plus and it&#8217;s just geeks all over the place so I&#8217;ve got a small contact list. I&#8217;m pretty willing to put people in the block circle so I don&#8217;t have to deal with them. I&#8217;m turning into a snob and it&#8217;s making me feel so much more mentally stable. I&#8217;m also pretty active in chronicling what&#8217;s been happening that&#8217;s awesome so I have a record. Sometimes I feel like I haven&#8217;t done anything (that&#8217;s imposter syndrome, I think) and then I&#8217;ll check Google Plus and there&#8217;s a whole pile of stuff. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p>3. I haven&#8217;t seen a movie all summer, except for a random rewatch of early 90s films like Jurassic Park and Independence Day. What&#8217;s been entertaining is when someone quotes a recent movie (Like I would&#8217;ve seen Captain America anyway? really?) and asks me if I&#8217;ve seen it, then either doesn&#8217;t believe my answer or attempts to explain the entire plot to give context for the funny moment that is, to me, meaningless. I cringe at this because I remember doing that myself and now I know how much the people I was accosting didn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m really having several weeks in a row that are awesome. I&#8217;ve had some weird days but that&#8217;s normal. There were parts of this past winter where I was really frustrated and I didn&#8217;t know why &#8230; I think the answer is that I was spending a lot of time caring and engaging with things I wanted to avoid. Also, I wasn&#8217;t thinking enough. This blog and Google Plus are productive as opposed to passive.</p>
<p>Cutting out my endless reading has made me more able to think clearly and deeply again. The point of the blog was to work on writing clearly. I&#8217;m still very wordy (I write like I talk) but it&#8217;s improving. My attention span in general is better. I can work on the laptop without stopping every few minutes to check some random website or play a mindless game.</p>
<p>In stepping back from media, too, I can see the effects of whatever is on TV on my friends. It means I&#8217;m sometimes out of the social loop but I hang out with people who talk a lot of shop so it doesn&#8217;t really seem to matter. The ebb and flow of conversation moves on past what was on &#8230; whatever &#8230; last night. I&#8217;m reading way more for the first time in years. I&#8217;m retaining more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all anecdotal but I wasn&#8217;t feeling fine when I was juggling all these inputs and now I feel amazing, with awesome things happening every day that I can put time and energy towards because I&#8217;m not putting time and energy towards the inputs. It&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>And the big reason I hadn&#8217;t done this before was I was afraid of losing my friends. But you know, now they text instead of call, they email instead of expect me on chat, and they&#8217;re cutting themselves off about the movies or the cat pictures. They&#8217;re friends, right? They adapt because they want to stick around.</p>
