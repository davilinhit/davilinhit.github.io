The antenna setup in the back of the plane. We were all about all these different ways to attach the antenna, internally and externally, but it turned out taping it in the back window was good enough.

Taxiing out and taking off at Troutdale.

Our most excellent pilot and antenna operator.

We did a few circles on the Washington side of the river to give the Rocky Butte ground team a chance to get up and running ot see if they could catch our packets. We had no idea if we were going to even be able to make contact.

But we did! And we headed north to the west of Mt St Helens.

We warned the ground team we might lose them for a minute or two and we took a detour to check out the caldera.

We ended up spending a lot of time circling over Morton, WA, but that was about where our signal problems started. We did continue on to Kapowsin Field, right at the edge of Seattle airspace, at about 10,000 feet.

On the way back south, we moved the antenna to the front right window but we couldn't shake the communication problems. We lost both SMS and radio to Rocky Butte so when we turned around the ground team wasn't entirely sure where we were and we weren't ever really able to re-establish contact. The antennas have a very narrow beam over which they can receive so if we had to be exactly where the Rocky Butte team was pointing their antenna, and for the most part we weren't.

We were also considering fuel/range issues and ended up deciding to just head back to Troutdale and call it a win.

On final to Troutdale, with bonus propellers. (It's actually not really possible with iPhone to take a picture out the front window that doesn't catch the prop.)
