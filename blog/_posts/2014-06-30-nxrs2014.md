description: Going to NXRS to get my L1 high level rocket cert.
---

I went out to Brothers, Oregon, to Oregon Rocketry's annual Northwest Xtreme Rocket Show in hopes of getting my Level 1 and Level 2 certs with my black and yellow 4" Sentinel on a 38mm motor I intended to buy out there. It turns out I forget to take pictures when I'm busy chasing rockets, but these are a few right before the first flight.

I went for my L1 on a Cesaroni H225 motor and it lifted off the pad all right but toward the end of the burn, the motor's o-ring failed and it CATOed. Luckily it was high enough that the force separated the rocket and ejected the parachute. Unfortunately, the retaining ring retained the nozzle of the motor while the motor casing shot out the front of the rocket.

The rocket floated down to a fairly soft landing in a sage bush behind the flightline and I had two good bearings from people who'd seen the motor casing come down, so I recovered all the pieces. 

Bob from Sunriver Observatory cheerfully replaced the motor casing and motor, which was fantastic, but he didn't have any more H225s so I accepted an H125 instead. The models predicted a very low and slow flight but I collected second opinions and decided to go for it. 

I cleaned up the rocket and discovered the end of the tube against which the motor retaining ring fits was eaten through on one side so I cut a two-inch piece of cardboard motor package and glued it around for stability. I built the new motor, waited over night to Sunday morning with calm wind, and lit it off at 8am.

It lifted really, really, realllllllly slow and then I didn't have the ejection timing quite right so it waited a lonnnnnnnnnnng time after apogee to finally blow and separate. My (acting?) prefect walked out with me to recover it and discovered another rocket had landed on it, shock cords crossing. We untangled them and found a pristine rocket, no zippering, no shredding, nothing. It's basically built like a tank so it looks great and it's ready to fly again.
