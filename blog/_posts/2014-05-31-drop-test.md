There's a drop tower at Portland State which runs the height of the six stories of the Engineering Building's atrium. Dr. Weislogel at Portland State uses it to do NASA-funded capillary action research. There's a container that you bring up to the top and you place your items to be tested in the container, hanging by a cord, and the container takes care of the air resistance for you while your item essentially experiences microgravity or free-fall until it hits the high Gs when it comes to a halt. 

We got permission to take our rocket avionics module and do a drop test in the tower. 

Nathan put up an iPython notebook that's web-browsable with the full data write-up. <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/psas.github.io/Launch-11/droptest/2014-05-16-drop-1/results.ipynb?create=1">Check it out</a>.

The rest of these are my photos. It's a pretty sweet setup.
