I grew veggies in the ground last year but the ground's pretty terrible and I could have been more attentive, so I've been looking forward to giving it another try this year. I started out by building raised beds in March. 

There are three 3'x6' beds about 20" high. I used cedar fence boards and pine studs, then coated them with linseed oil. Total cost was about $100 and one day's work.

In April, I planted in the right-hand two beds. They're each 3 feet wide by 6 feet long by 2 feet high. I bought a couple of blueberries and potted them in between the raised beds. I'm watering by hand until the irrigation stuff arrives.

Now that it's May, we've started having our usual scattered, unpredictable mix of thunderstorms, warm rain, hail, brilliant sunshine, and blue skies, so the garden has exploded in size over the last couple of weeks. 

The irrigation stuff arrived. My cat approves.

My boss started tomatoes from seed and ended up with too many so I now have way more tomatoes than I know what to do with. I'm going to move over some of the broccoli and cabbage from the right-hand box to the tomato box to make some room.
